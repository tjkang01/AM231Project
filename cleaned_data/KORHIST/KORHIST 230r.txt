After this course, you will not have only read the major works on premodern Korean history, but also will have formed your own arguments on the major issues surrounding premodern Korea!
You will be able to understand how to read and criticize history books.
Be sure to familiarize yourself with Korean studies research trends, associated research methodology trends, and jargon in order to voice your arguments along terms that are palatable to fellow students invested in the field. Otherwise, good ideas and observations may be misinterpreted.
Great course! Had a great atmosphere that encouraged open discussions about our reading. For me, it was a particularly special because it well prepared me for my senior-thesis.
