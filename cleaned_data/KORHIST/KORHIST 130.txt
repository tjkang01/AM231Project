Prof. Byington is the best. Just go to his office hours or, really, just meet him and you'll immediately understand why.As far as the class goes, Prof. Byington structured the material in a way that was relevant and interesting; he showed how history is very much alive and responds to modern events and contexts. It was a great class to take in order to contextualize the production of Korean history, but, really, the lessons learned in this class are applicable to the study of the history of any region.
This class is great; just be wary of the fact that enrollment is not likely to be high, and discussion could be a little lacking on occasion.
As a Korean, you will be able to understand an outsider's view of Korean history. The sources that back up the current narrative of Korean history will astonish you..;
A great class for those who are genuinely interested in Korean history and its issues today. For those coming from Korea, prepare to have many of your ideas on Korean history to be challenged.
