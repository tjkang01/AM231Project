Excellent in terms of learning specific history, but also grounded in a good theoretical feminist framework.
This course is very interesting but because it explores a somewhat alternative understanding of history it is best to have a strong handle on medieval Japanese history.
One of my favorite classes. I learned so much from this class and felt encouraged to keep learning more.
