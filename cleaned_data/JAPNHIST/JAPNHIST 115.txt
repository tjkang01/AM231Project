If you keep up with the readings and participate thoughtfully, you will gain much from the course. Professor Hardacre will reflect and strengthen the enthusiasm you show, and you will typically leave the sessions inspired to read more!
A very rewarding intellectual experience
The weekly workload is extremely reasonable, but be prepared to give your absolute best on the first short assignment and the final paper.
This course is great, be aware of the readings however. I think I consistently underestimated how many there were, though they really come in handy for the final paper. Hardacre is amazing, really knows her stuff, and is also extremely kind about it all--I never felt out of my depth even though this material was all pretty new to me. Make use of the fact the midterm is essentially a trial run for the final, even though it's short, it's extremely helpful in figuring out how to push it forward. I appreciated the flexibility (we really could write about anything we wanted), though I wish there was a bit more discussion because it was such a small class. We were invited to ask questions, but there wasn't a lot of back-and-forth between the students themselves. But I still learned a lot and felt excited about reading up on related topics on my own (and Prof. Hardacre was happy to give recommendations).
This is a really interesting class! I didn't know too much about Japanese religion so some things were lost on me, but I still learned a lot. Professor Hardacre is very sweet and understanding an is willing to help you! Overall, a very pleasant experience.
