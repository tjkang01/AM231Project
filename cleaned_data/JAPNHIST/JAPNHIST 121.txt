An excellent way to gain perspective on portions of East Asian history that are often glossed over, especially in regards to earlier periods.
The material you cover in this class makes putting in the effort definitely worth it. The discussions I had with my classmates were also very interesting.
This is a really great and interesting class that talks about women and gender in East Asia from pre-modern times until about 1945. I have personally developed a lot of discussion  leading and presentation skills based on this class. Professor Kawai is also very helpful and easy to get along with, making this class a pleasant and helpful experience. The topics very widely from week to week, and I feel like I have a more comprehensive understanding of histories of women in East Asia.
