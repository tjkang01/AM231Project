This course is great. Howell is a great lecturer and his tangents are what bring this course and the Tokugawa Era to life! The essays for this course are all reasonable and he likes to keep things fun with interesting prompts. You should take this course. There is a LOT of reading, but you can get away with not reading/looking up some of it.
This is a small class and really great.  The professor is amazing and the class is fun.  The material is interesting if you're at all interested in Japanese history.  The readings are a little bit heavy but interesting if you work through them.
This is a wonderful class and you learn very detailed information about the Tokugawa Period. My concentration is East Asian Studies and History, so this class was applicable for my studies. However, I personally believe that such a class is necessary to understand the changing Japanese economy today and trace parallels between history and contemporary troubles.
Readings were wonderful at times, dry at other times. Professor Howell is hilarious if you appreciate dry humor. Generally, a great overview of Tokugawa Japanese history. Take this class if you have east asian or Japanese history inclinations, and you probably won't be disappointed.
Teacher is great, funny, and nice!
Professor Howell is a great lecturer - I found myself engaged during every single class. Even subjects that you might not think you would find interesting, he somehow found a way to make interesting. Though he goes on tangents frequently, the tangents are very informative, as they are not only about Tokugawa Japan but about modern Japan as well. As he is very personable and funny, I feel like he was the professor I felt most comfortable with this semester.
Professor is very knowledgeable and effective in his lectures.
