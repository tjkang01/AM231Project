As long as you are prepared with the language skills necessary for the readings.
Only join this class if you have a burning desire to learn more about how texts in Edo-period Japan used to be written, and to read them aloud; if you wish to discuss the meaning of said texts, or if several hours of preparation a week sounds unpleasant, then this class is not for you.
I would recommend it strongly to someone who wants to or needs to be able to read Edo printed materials like texts, ehon or kibyoshi. I would not recommend it to someone wanting to learn about cultural history.
