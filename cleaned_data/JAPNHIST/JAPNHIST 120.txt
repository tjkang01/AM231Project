Prof. Hardacre leads a wonderful class! The book selection is broad without being overwhelming, and we spend as much time learning what to do (or not to do!) to be a good scholar and writer as we do learning about Japanese religion, which makes it an incredibly useful course not only for specialists in this area but for anyone looking to progress as a scholar. I wish I could have taken it earlier in my time as a student!
Don't be scared off by reading a whole book a week! Don't hesitate to take it even if you're not religion-focused.
This class will teach you a lot not only about modern Japanese religion but also how to read academic texts critically.  Prepare to be reading a fair amount, and come to class prepared to discuss the texts, and you'll be fine.
