This is a great reward for having made it through the Old Irish Workbook. You might not fully understand the value and aesthetic of Old Irish until you get to this point, and can study the poetry of this wonderfully intricate language. The course will help you appreciate medieval Irish literature more fully.
An excellent continuation to Old Irish.
