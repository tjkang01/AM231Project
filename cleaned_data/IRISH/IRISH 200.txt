If you're interested in working with the early vernacular literature of Ireland, this course is essential, yet be aware that Old Irish is a very difficult language to learn, requiring constant study and revision.
It is a difficult but rewarding class
By all means take it, but be prepared to work hard! Old Irish is no joke; and you WILL probably break your teeth, :) However, if you succeed, you will learn the most amazing language in existence, so yes, by all means, take it and see how you like it.
Listen to Tomas and take good notes.  He says nothing that wouldn't be helpful.
