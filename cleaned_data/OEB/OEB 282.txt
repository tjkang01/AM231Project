Though this class is "easy," this does not mean you don't have to do any work.  The students who took this class were driven and interesting, so everyone pulled their weight in class.  So, though we all knew we would do well (and so it was "easy"), we all still worked very hard to produce work we were proud of.
This course is an absolute blast and a must for premeds.  You get a concrete understanding of the diseases that you hear about all the time in the media.  Challenges you to think critically about infections from an evolutionary standpoint.  Lots of fun!!!
Professor Sabeti is an incredible resource, and has a wealth of knowledge that she is more than willing to share.  Be proactive in asking questions and having her share her work with the class.  You will need to do work on your own in order to learn the material (unless you have a background in pathology and infectious diseases), but the class offers a great opportunity to learn from Professor Sabeti and your peers, and to practice developing curricula for teaching biology.
This was possibly my favorite class I've ever taken here.  I really enjoyed the material and getting to spend two hours a week with possibly the most brilliant professor I've ever met was incredible.  Hearing about her research, learning the material of the course, helping to design a new Gen Ed class were all incredible experiences.  Definitely take this class!
