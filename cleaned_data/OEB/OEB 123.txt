It's basically a grad level class despite the course number. Also be prepared for a fair amount of disorganization between different parts of the class.
Overall, I enjoyed this class a lot. It was one of my favorite upper level science classes for sure. The majority of the students were graduate students or post-docs, so as an undergrad, learning to keep pace with them and think like them were excellent learning experiences. Although this class was also one of the hardest classes I've ever taken, it was definitely worth it. I only wish it were easier to study for the exams, and that the labs/lab report guidelines were more organized.
