You are likely to learn something.  It's worth taking the course for this reason alone or for the opportunity to interact with your colleagues that you may not otherwise see very often.
Thought-provoking intro to a variety of central concepts in evo bio
The course surveys modern trends in evolutionary biology and is a good starting point for new PhD students.
It's a good class to take if you want to broaden your knowledge of evolutionary biology or become acquainted with the faculty studying evolution at Harvard.
The reading material was interesting and the weekly discussions were helpful, but the computer labs were not as useful as they could have been. Also, plan for unplanned class meetings.
This course is particularly valuable for students looking to learn new methods in phylogenetics and engage the recent literature. However, learning the methods requires students to be proactive, try things on their own, and not rely on the basic two-hour introduction during sections.
the class is a lot of fun and you'll learn a lot.  you learn both theory and application, and get to put it all into practice at the end.  the students get to direct the course quite a lot.
Great material covered and very insightful discussion, but loose structuring
This class is relevant to people with an interest in phylogenetic theory, particularly if they are interest in gene tree-species tree conflict (as a large portion of the class focused on that).  This class is for those who have already taken a systematics course and are generally familiar with the literature of phylogenetics.
Though sometimes course content can be redundant, all topics were presented and discussed thoroughly.
Useful if you want to work with population genomics tools.
good introduction to genomic methods
great for keeping up on the current literature
The overall purpose of the course was not cohesive.  Should not be taken unless you have a strong understanding of genomics.
Great course with many interesting papers.  It provided a good background in comparative genomics, and jumping off point with which one could further explore the field.
Gives good exposure to developments in the field of genomics, especially if you want a more in-depth perspective, but it could be better organized.
If you do/are interested in doing population genetic or phylogenetic research, it's worth your while.
