This course is a great way to explore some of the most fascinating questions in evolution, such as "why are there so many species?".
This course has a pretty fierce reading load, but if you put the time in, you can learn a huge amount of really valuable information and probably come out the other side with a publishable paper.
It's a lot of work, but you come out with a solid understanding of adaptive radiation and the issues facing the field.
"If you want to learn more about evolutionary biology from the best instructor you can imagine, you should take this course. Be aware, though, to not take other courses at the same time and to dedicate most of your time to this one course."
Interesting discussions about an interesting topic with one of the foremost experts on the topic, however it may not be broadly applicable to those not 100% interested in that topic
OEB has so few graduate offerings, so I'd recommend the course on that alone. That said, this is the most fun I've had taking a course in years. This course is great, loved it.
