This class is great if and only if you are interested in METHODOLOGY.
It has been so much fun taking this course. The instructor has such a great personality and the classes are very inviting and interesting!
This course is worth the time if you would like a relatively light and entertaining romp through the latest in Microbial Ecology literature. Professor Cavanaugh, though often off on random tangents, is none-the-less sharp and leads often informative discussions.
