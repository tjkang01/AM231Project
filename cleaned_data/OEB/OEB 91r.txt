Excellent course if you want to conduct research for course credit.
Make sure to have a supportive faculty member as they make the course fully worthwhile and engaging.
Great way to explore a subject of interest on your own terms. Allows for close interaction with a professor (something every OEB student should take advantage of).
This is a great experience to expand upon your research skills and to learn laboratory techniques. Most of the work is independent, but help is there if you need it.
