This class is an absolutely wonderful introduction into the broad and complex world of conservation.  Conservation is a very multidisciplinary field, and there is ample opportunity to connect topics discussed here to other fields.  If they offer this course again, you should DEFINITELY take it if you are even thinking about it because it is very relaxed, but SO informative - the best of all worlds.
Good profs, interesting material, next to no work and next to no structure.
ABSOLUTELY AMAZING. the class is about conservation, but anyone with an interest in participating in thoughtful discussions and practicing their presentation skills would benefit from the seminar-style of this course. definitely a unique, intimate setting with highly qualified professors.
Great! Instructors were wonderful!
