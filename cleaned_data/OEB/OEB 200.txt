This is an amazing class! It's run entirely in discussion format, which is a really great way to learn and think about the material, and it's also more fun than listening to lecture and doing homework assignments. You get to learn a lot from the other students as well as the professor.
This course is very interesting and Mansi is a very knowledgable professor. However, the course is loosely structured, so only very self-motivated students should take this class.
You're going to learn a lot. And learn how to discuss various topics and techniques in depth.
