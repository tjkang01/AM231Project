There's a lot of assigned reading, with very interesting discussion, primarily by professors and post-docs.  If you're dissertation is in any way related to either topic being discussed, the grant writing assignment is very useful.
Excellent opportunity to interact closely with faculty members and to get familiar with an exciting field of research.
Great class in plant anatomy. You'll be very very familiar with all plant cell types and function at the end of the class. The professor likes quirky plant poems too.
This course is excellent to gain a solid understand of basic plant anatomy, and would benefit anyone also studying plant physiology or evolution.
