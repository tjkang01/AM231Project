This class was really fun and I would definitely recommend taking it if you are interested in oceanography and ocean management! It is mostly a discussion course of readings so it will be different for everyone who takes it. The readings include both science and policy.
One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Professor McCarthy is definitely my favourite professor here, and it was a fantastic opportunity to engage in learning about a topic that interests me in a small group setting. Every week our discussions were engaging and interesting, and 2.5 hours flew by in no time.
If you're interested in the subject of marine ecosystems generally, and have a specific interest ranging form harmful algal blooms to international climate change policy, you should take this course.
