This is great for your last semester of thesis-writing. If you need the money and the incentive though, don't take this as a class in other semesters but see if you can work on your thesis/other project as a job (you cannot do both at once). It makes you feel better about staying late for lab and can help pay for relaxing after you are finished!
Independent research class...
excellent chance to work with a faculty member or graduate student in the lab
Be self-directed.  Have an adviser with some free time.
Only do a thesis if you really, really want to.
N/A
Take this course if you really want to do a thesis or independent project. David Haig is everything you could ask for in an adviser-supportive, flexible, understanding, and brilliant. He really cares about his students and makes himself very available to help you with your research. Other students writing their theses met with their professors only occasionally. Professor Haig made time every week to discuss my progress and findings. I recommend this course with reservations only because it really is up to YOU how much you get out of this course. If you are certain you want to do a thesis, then I recommend it with tremendous enthusiasm. David Haig is the best thesis adviser you could have.
It's a great way to do research and know you'll have time for it.  Make sure to get your Biolab trainings done early.
