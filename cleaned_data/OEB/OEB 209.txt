It is challenging but the results are rewarding and you will become a better scientist.
I would recommend this course to someone who really wanted to dive into this topic actively, and do a bunch of reading (or someone who was already familiar with the material), but not to someone who was looking to be taught in a standard lecture format.
You need to take it.
This course is an excellent opportunity to learn about the Ediacaran period and subsequent Cambrian radiation from a leading expert in the field. The course was very interesting, and Andy is fantastic.
This course completely changed my path in grad school. Andy is a fantastic lecturer who really takes an interest in his students. I was always excited to come to class. You will be presenting at least 3 times throughout the semester (depending on the class size) but presentations are much more like informal discussions. It is really an amazing seminar course.
