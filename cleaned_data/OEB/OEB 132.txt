This class was no work, really interesting, especially if you're into south american plants and ecosystems. Professor Holbrook and Professor Goldstein were great, and we had snacks each class. Definitely take this if you're looking for an interesting plant elective.
The material was interesting but presented in a very disorganized manner. It was the first year so the next time this course is offered it will be much better, but time management was an issue. Students also had a range in background knowledge (and interest) which could have been frustrating when they dwelled on a concept that was more advanced than what many of us understood. The professors were very nice though, totally knew there stuff and brought snacks every week (only met once a week, but that will probably change), but there was too much material for them to cover it all sufficiently. The workload is light but if you don't pay attention in class you won't be able to do it.
I would recommend for students who have an interest in tropical ecosystems and who are comfortable reading scientific papers.
This class is interesting and the professors are hilarious and knowledgable. Definitely take this class if you have an interest in plants and tropical ecosystems. A real eye-opener.
Absolutely stellar course, unlike any other at Harvard. If you are interested in plants and South America, this is the place to start.
Take it. Just make sure the syllabus is 100% finalized. This course would have been stronger if we had had consistently assigned readings and problem sets and if we could have have gone to the lab and seen the equipment and methods that we read about, which was promised in the syllabus.
Good course. Cool material and very reasonable workload, just make sure you're interested in plant physiology
