If you're interested in evo-devo, this course discusses recent, exciting papers in the field.
The course provides a great overview of evolutionary concepts/problems that are being evaluated through developmental biology. The discussions are friendly, and the instructor's knowledge provides a great basis for getting a good understanding for the field.
This subject is entirely opaque. It's tough, but for undergrads interested in taking a course on something very specific in a heavily researched field, it's a great class.
Arkhat is fantastic, well worth taking a class with. It's a good chance to learn a lot of EDB, think about how you'd actually test hypotheses using current research to draw on, and practice presentations in a friendly and supportive environment.
The quality of the discussions will highly depend on the level of the students taking the class
Good class, if you're looking for a high-level discussion of evo-devo.
It's hard to imagine a better seminar for those broadly interested in evolutionary developmental biology.
Good exposure to core ideas of evo-devo, helps you clarify a lot of the key ideas and think about underlying causation in a way that many evo-devo classes don't.
This course is a good opportunity to hone your presentation skills.  Everyone is very supportive so it is a "safe" place to practice.
Definitely a great option if you are interested in evo-devo.
I learnt about current work in the Evo Devo field.
Try to do the outside readings.
Very nice in-depth overview on evo-devo.
Great class!  It was a relaxing environment and I enjoyed learning and discussing evo-devo.
Arkhat is a great resource -- an extremely knowledgeable and open teacher, in the best sense of the word.  Read the papers well!
