This is a low stress class but is unique because you are still motivated to learn a lot without the pressure of exams and huge papers during the semester.  The small class environment with two great teachers is extremely unique at Harvard and I wish there were more classes organized like it. The online component was also pretty cool because it had the other students of a "bigger class" without taking away from your own teacher's attention because they had their own teachers.  I learned a lot and did a lot of work for my final project, but it was work that I did not mind doing because it was something I could choose to study that I enjoyed.  Mark and Scott were the best, and always impressed me with how much time they spent helping us with our final projects.
Anyone interested in phylogemonic researches should definitely take this course.
