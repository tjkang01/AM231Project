Ecophysiology was a great course and experience. It brought together scientists from a number of specialties to talk about the diversity of research, techniques, and questions in the field.
Take it.
This is an excellent, discussion-based course that exposes students to a wide variety of research in ecophysiology and is great for any biology student interested in ecology, physiology, or genetics.
Definitely a graduate-style seminar.
