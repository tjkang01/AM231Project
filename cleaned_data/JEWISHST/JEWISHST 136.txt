Take this course!  You'll learn a lot, and you'll have fun doing it!
Shaye Cohen leads an amazing class that covers fantastic material in a fun, interactive seminar.
If a student is interested in Jewish history and has a background or interest in the topic, I would highly recommend the course.  I wouldn't suggest it for anyone with a casual interest.
