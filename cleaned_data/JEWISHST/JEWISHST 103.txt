The professor is innovative, approachable, and an exciting teacher who really 'gets' her students and her subject. She creates a family out of her students. The subject is interesting, rarely taught, and creatively approached by the professor. All in all, one of my favorite classes at Harvard.
The final project for this course is pretty fun, you get to learn about cultures that you probably never even knew that much about before, and it's not a lot of work - definitely worth taking
A course with really interesting readings and perspectives which encourage great class discussion.
