This class, in combination with Former Prophets, exposes students to a huge swathe of the biblical corpus and highlights the vibrant and creative compositional work which ties the various texts together. It cuts to the heart of the Hebrew Bible and what that document actually is.
Fabulous teacher and the most scintillating literature there is. What's not to love?
This course will definitely expand the student's toolkit for approaching the Bible, and expose him or her to a new way of seeing the "way the text speaks."
