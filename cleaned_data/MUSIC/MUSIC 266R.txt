Work with Vijay!
An amazing opportunity to study with Prof. Iyer. Don't miss out!
This class is awesome -- it's basically lessons with Prof. Iyer every week.
Not only is it a treasure to work with Vijay Iyer, but it's also a great opportunity to craft ones own compositions and work with really awesome musicians at this school!
This was an awesome experience. My friend and I found an excuse to practice together each week and write our own music, all while taking lessons from Vijay.
It doesn't get better than this.
Work with professor Iyer at all costs, whether in this class or another.
