This was an amazing class. Challenging because of the topic and sheer amount of material, but entirely worth it. Definitely one of the best of my graduate career. Enthusiastic, responsive, instructor; highly productive and thought-provoking discussions; fascinating materials; good balance/connection between the theoretical and the applied.
A fantastic experience; unique to my time at Harvard.  Seize the opportunity and expand your horizions.
This class is what you imagine graduate school will be like.
The readings were very well chosen. I enjoyed developing my research interests in the final paper. Discussion could be very interesting or sometimes disorganized.
Very interesting readings
Absolutely awesome. You will learn so much, not only about the course material, but how to think critically about ethnomusicological theory and engage with various case studies.
A difficult, but ultimately rewarding course that explores many of the possible figurative and analytical relationships between music and language.
The course started dry, but became more engaging as the semester continued.
An excellent introduction to ethnomusicology and the relationship between music and language in many cultures.
Since it's a grad seminar, you have a lot of freedom to design your own final project, which is great.
