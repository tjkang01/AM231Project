Take this course if/when it's offered! Not only will you learn to play another instrument, but you will also get to learn about the time period and better understand the amateur viol consort as a life style and cultural artifact.
Definitely take this class!
This class is a unique opportunity for those who love Renaissance music and historical performance.  Learning to play an instrument and rehearsing (and tuning) takes patience, but it is so worth it!
