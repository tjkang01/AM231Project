This is the most cutting-edge class I've even taken in my life, and it's not just the interface of Skyping with colleagues in Montreal. The course is truly interdisciplinary, including readings from media studies, critical theory, and philosophy.
stretch your boundaries!
Emily is fantastic, and the Canada trip was a lot of fun. However, this definitely became the class that took up the most time for me this semester. Not necessarily a good or bad thing, but I would hesitate to recommend it to anyone who has a lot of commitments/classes already.
Great introduction/onramp to Science and Technology Studies, actively and compassionately led by ED, great musicology class for the out-of-the-box musicologist
