This was a great opportunity to be involved in something experimental and generative.
DON'T MISS IT IF IT COMES UP AGAIN!
It's a fun, experimental, and cool class. It broadens your perspective. It helps you understand your environment and daily lives. It brings you a new understanding toward a new field.
If this course gets offered again, clear your schedule to make room for it.  I can say without qualification that it was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!
