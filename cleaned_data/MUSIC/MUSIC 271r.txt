To have another perspective on composing
This is my first Fromm Seminar, but the opportunity to spend a couple hours weekly with a visiting composer seems like an enormous privilege, and John's music made it especially rewarding.
I enjoyed this course a lot. I came to it with less fixed ideas about the pieces in question (I didn't know any of them extremely well), so I really appreciated all the different modes of analysis. I know some others felt that Roger was looking for too specific of an outcome on certain pieces, but I didn't mind that. Wonderful other people in the class, wonderful discussions.
