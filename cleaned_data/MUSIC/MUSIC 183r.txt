Take it.
This class is an excellent opportunity to learn research techniques while studying any topic in 19th or 20th century music performance that interests you.
You must be self-motivated to study your topic thorougly.
This class really only has one assignment, a 10-20 page paper due at the end of finals period. The rest of the semester will be sent individually researching your topic, and presenting your findings every couple weeks.It helps if you know exactly what you want to research right from the very first week (though you have time to figure it out later if you need to)
Several times while talking to Levin, I found his interpretation to be so compelling that I was moved to the verge of tears. Watching him go through scores of Beethoven and provide his interpretation (especially opus 109, 110, 111) was like having a revelation.
