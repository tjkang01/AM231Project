RCS is an amazing way to engage with high-level musical performance and make friends at the same time, not to mention to get some fun and painless course credit!
I LOVE RCS. It's been where I've found my community on campus, and have grown tremendously as a musician as well. The more involved and committed you are, the more you'll get out of it! Pay attention in rehearsal, apply for leadership positions, go to social events, and RCS can become a family.
Wonderful people and wonderful environment that fosters friendship, growth, compassion, and a hard work ethic.
This is a five hour commitment every week. Rehearsals are required everyday for the week of the show and last 3-4 hours each. If you decide to take this for credit, you are committing to a year. The attendance policy is extremely strict. I recommend giving a lot of thought as to whether this is something you want to stick to.
RCS is a great musical opportunity for anyone wanting to get involved on campus. Not only is it a group of talented singers, but also a community that feels like home.
If you are a singer, this is a great way to get a unique perspective on women's choral music and be involved in concerts with amazing visiting conductors, go on tour, and be part of a tight-knit community.
RCS has taken up the most of my time here at Harvard, but I wouldn't have it any other way. This choir is so important to me, and the music we sing is so important to the community. My experiences with RCS will stay with me forever.
If your are taking RCS for course credit, make sure you are 100% going to be available for all rehearsals, concerts (we have many), and other engagements.  The choir is inflexible with legitimate conflicts like midterms and other commitments and I've personally been asked to miss a concert because I would not be able to attend 2 hours of a dress rehearsal, despite months of extensive rehearsal time before.
I LOVE RCS so much! Such an amazing community
