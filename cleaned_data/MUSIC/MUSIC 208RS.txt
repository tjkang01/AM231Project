If you are interested in getting a "thrown in the deep end" kind of introduction to African ethnomusicology, then this is the right class for you! It studies in depth exactly what it says it will, and delivers!
This class is a great opportunity to learn more about both ethnography and ethnomusicology on Africa.
This is a fantastic course for anyone working towards a primary research area in African music, as you will cover many of the relevant musical ethnographies from across the continent. It also gives you a chance to discuss the issues that come up in these books in class, and situate them in relation to your own work.
Very good survey of the essential literature, with a diverse reading list covering many parts of the continent and many types of genres. Shelemay is an excellent discussion leader and gives very useful feedback. A lot of reading, but worth it if you're interested in the material
