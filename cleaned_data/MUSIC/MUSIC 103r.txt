I highly recommend taking this course and any course taught by Professor Johnson.
This really is a wonderful chance to dig deep into the choreographic process.  Jill does a phenomenal job of bringing great movement out of people and really does make you analyze and think about what you're doing, constantly probing your own awareness of movement as an individual and as part of an ensemble, approaching it from technical ("More epaulment!"), sensational ("How does that feel from the inside?"), and intellectual ("What were you thinking there?") views.  You really get inside movement and it's pretty wonderful.
This is not a typical class; this is more like a life learning experience that will permeate everything you do, the way you think, the way you perceive, on a most fundamental level of being. This is not just a course you will recall fondly in late adulthood; this is a course that becomes an integral part of you. Take it. You won't regret it. Jill is an unbelievable teacher, mentor, and artist, and the hours that you get to spend in class and in the studio will be the highlight of your week.
Seeing Jill Johnson's artist mind at work is a once-in-a-lifetime experience.
