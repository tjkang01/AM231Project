This is an exceptional course. These are readings I'll continue returning to throughout my academic work, and we had great freedom and support to work with our individual research interests throughout the course.
Some courses may emphasise breadth, others depth - this one definitely attempts both.
This is a rigorous course that takes students through a formidable body of literature, in music studies, black studies, critical theory, and much more.  The readings and discussions are challenging and productive to new ways of thinking and questioning. The professor has a strong command of and devotion to the material.
Lots and lots of work, but very, very worth it
fantastic overview of many subjects relevant to improvisation. Lots of reading you will likely want to come back to later, not enough time to thoroughly process them throughout the semester.
This course will change the way you think about music and living.
