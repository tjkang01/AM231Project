This class provides a great introduction to a number of highly relevant, contemporary topics in music theory. It does not delve deeply into the mechanics of individual theories, but it fulfills its function as an historiographical experience.
Great overview, enthusiastic instructor, wonderful guest speakers
This course is definitely on the right track toward fostering a productive relationship between the branches of theory, history and performance within the filed of music, and works well in bridging music with other disciplines (e.g. pedagogy, philosophy).
It will raise more questions than it'll answer. Whether that is a good or a bad thing is entirely dependent on what you want from the course, and your expectations.
A great course that covers the most important issues in music theory today
