This seminar might be more effective if geared toward students with reading knowledge of French. Thomas Kelly facilitates discussion well and is accessible and helpful outside of class.
This course will inform your research even if you think your interests have nothing to do with its content.
Music and Empire changed the way I listen to music and watch performances, particularly opera. Exoticism and orientalism are so pervasive we don't even perceive them, and I believe we need to defamiliarize ourselves with these sorts of conventions.
This is a wonderful class both for thinking through issues of music and empire specifically and for more generally thinking about how music, material culture, power, and difference relate to one another.
This is a course not to be missed. This seminar provides a safe space for confronting some of the most difficult and challenging intersections of society and art. Under the supervision of a profoundly sensitive and rigorous thinker, students are encouraged to grapple with complex postcolonial theory in relation to staples of the Western canon, and musics marginalised by that canon.
It is really important to take, no matter what kind of music you study!
Taking a Wagner seminar with Professor Abbate is not an opportunity to be missed !!!
I honestly feel that this is one of the best courses I have ever taken. Not just for the opportunity to engage with /Tristan/ in some depth, but for the new ways of thinking about this music that Carolyn Abbate inspired. It was so exciting.
