I would recommend it. The course challenged basic assumptions about music education and helped me to shape/refine my ideas about what constitutes musical understanding. And the chance to have discussions with Hasty and benefit from his insight is not one to pass up lightly.
It's a much more meaningful class than many of the undergraduate concentration requirements in the music department.  The discussions were almost always great and I always came alway stimulated and provoked.  If you are interested in philopshical and musicological approaches to music (which unfortunately many undergrads are) then it will be a very good experience.
Unfortunately, I consistently felt that I was wasting my time in this class, and that little progress was ever made.
For performers, it will really change the way you approach learning and performing a piece.
This is a course that will only be interesting and informative to you if you are interested in philosophical issues of musical performance, and if you take the initiative to deeply think about these issues yourself.
One of the best classes in the music department, as long as you approach it with a curious mind and your musical self-interest at heart.
Be prepared to defend your position, as many of these topics are divisive.
It is a very interesting and well-taught course, but it's hampered by disorganization.
It's a good way of approaching an interesting but somewhat neglected topic.
This class is welcome in its focus on performance, but it will only be useful in what you make of the class.
