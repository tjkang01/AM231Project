It's the right place to look at your work in a critical way and to process the critics in a productive and positive way
I haven't had any better and more challenging guidance as a composer than during my sessions with Chaya.
Great class, very interesting, brief but intense bouts of works spread sporadically (and a bit unpredictably) throughout the year.
Developing your own musical world by continuously adding new challenges
It is great
It is a great opportunity to discussed about your music.
Take this class, if you want to improve your creativity
