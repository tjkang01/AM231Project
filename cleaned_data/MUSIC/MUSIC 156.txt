Unfortunately I didn't learn as much as I had hoped - I assume this will get better as the course material gets ironed out
This course taught me a lot about tonal counterpoint, a.k.a. J.S. Bach especially. It is taught from an angle of composition. Even if you are interested only in understanding Bach's music (and not in trying to write similar music yourself) this course is very useful in that it gives you a deep appreciation of the technical problems Bach faced and overcame.
Not to be melodramatic or anything, but it will actually change your relationship to Bach forever.  I tell it like it is.
Need a sincere desire to learn more about Bach theory
It probably won't be Dr. Beaudoin next year, as he's a one-year hire, but if it is, TAKE IT.  He's an incredible teacher.
Richard Beaudoin is a PERFECT professor. I would recommend any course taught by him, even if the subject were less interesting and the music less beautiful - but the combination of such a professor with the music of Bach is irresistable. Really one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard.
Prof. Beaudoin was awesome, so it will be different in other years.
This is a wonderful course for any music enthusiast, whether you plan to go into musicology, theory, or just enjoy it as an avocation.
