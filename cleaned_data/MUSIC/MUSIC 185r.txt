Excellent course. Everything is free-form and improvised. The professor is an excellent mentor and provides individual attention to each student to realize his or her own improvisational goals.
This class changed the way I look as music, not only improvisation.
Prof. Levin has a staggering amount of knowledge and experience in classical music (especially mozart and bach and beethoven) and he can show through his master-style classes a myriad of different ways to improve/make your improvisation more interesting and varied. Prof. Levin has high standards and is very kind and encouraging and non-judgmental; this attitude spreads to the rest of the classroom.  A very hands-on, broad-thinking class.  I learned and came to appreciate the architecture of many pieces by Mozart, Beethoven, and Bach.  I have a much greater respect for these composers, Prof. Levin, and anyone who successfully improvises now.
