This is an amazing course if you are interested in experimental/electronic music and improvisation, though the format of the course can change from semester to semester.  For instance, last year it was primarily max/msp programming course, whereas this semester it focused much more intensely on actual performance/improvisation/interpretation of text and graphic scores.  No matter what though, if you are interested in sound in ways beyond traditional/conservative understandings of "music," this course will be right up your alley!
Hans continues to remain the most amazing professor on this campus. If you want to learn anything about improvisation and being a better musician, take this course.
Prof Tutschku is an amazing artist and teacher!
One of most fun and rewarding classes offered at Harvard! Not to be missed for any student interested in electronic music performance and technology.
Terrific place to workshop ideas.
Just take the course! You end up having a bunch of tools to work in the future.
If you want to improve your programming skills in MAX/MSP and apply this to artistic work, you might want to consider taking this course. Furthermore you get some interesting perspectives on how to use electronics in your composition (based on Hans's personal usage of electronics).
