I've learned a lot of good theory, I've listened to a lot of good music, and I've been encouraged to work on a project of my own design that I might not be able to write in any other class. That's pretty good, all things considered.
It's a great course if you have an open mind, and are willing to think and write about music from a different perspective.
This class has made me think about the big questions, not just those concerning music, but those concerning life. This may sound romantic but I do believe that music plays a fundamental role in our experience of life and due to Professor Hasty's open-mindedness and thought-provoking interpretation of music and philosophy, I feel as though I have been given the opportunity to think about the questions that most concern me. This class provides the opportunity for its participants to take risks and think big.
Be prepared to contribute to the structure and forward motion of the class.  That is NOT a criticism: on the contrary, what Prof. Hasty models is a form of academic pursuit in which the dialogue is central.  If you put your mind to it, you can shape a conversation from the pieces which are already there.  It does take practice, and that practice is built into the course.
