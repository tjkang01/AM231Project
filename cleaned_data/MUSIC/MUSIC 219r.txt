The teacher is very open and changed a few topics and composers to talk about according to students' suggestions. Possibly this is the reason it became so versatile and interesting in the overall view of the course.
This is a great survey of American music and writings on American music.  Even the students in the class who are supposedly American music specialists learned a great deal!
Great overview, great professor, great feedback on writing, lots of work, nitpicky about writing (style over substance)
This class is at times frustrating because the workload is constant and sometimes it is hard to take a day to think. However, it certainly also makes you a more confident reader.

Prepare for a heavy work load, and pace yourself over the course of the semester.
A challenging and thought-provoking insight into American musical history.
Attack the term paper research from there very beginning, and find a way to continue with it aggressively throughout the semester!
