Very interesting way to analyse music. Also very interesting to analyse the music of your peers. The skills you build by doing so are extremely useful in the everyday mechanics of composing and for future teaching on composition.
It is a place of deep understanding and discovery of different musical worlds
Chaya is an excellent teacher, or in this class' case, curator, approaching analysis from a different (compositional) and very helpful angle.
Unfortunately won't be offered any more...
This was a series of analyses of new music works of the 20th and 21st centuries. It was a really amazing class - my favorite of the semester. Chaya is brilliant, and I seem to learn about music from her very presence in the room. The course structure is very elegant (first half is presentations on Scelsi, Lachenmann, and Huber by Chaya, second half is presentations by students, on newer pieces of their choosing) and class discussions are always enlightening.
In this course you analyse music from the point of view of a composer, which is really very interesting. When you're a composer yourself, this helps you for your own compositions, when you're a musicologist/music theorist, this helps you to get another approach to music analysis, one which is more driven by artistic goals/perspectives.
An outstanding and challenging course for anyone interested in musical analysis beyond the confines of traditional music theory.
If you want to develop an original and personal analytical skill
