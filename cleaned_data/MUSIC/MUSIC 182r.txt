You must be dedicated and interested in your semester project, or it can become very tedious after a couple weeks.
If you're interesting in 17th and 18th-century music and performance practice at all, this class is a must. The workload is one 10-page paper with a performance, or one 20-page paper, for the whole semester. However, it's the culmination of a semester's worth of research, and is only worthwhile if research is done consistently.
The perfect way to study aspects of performance practice that you have always been curious about and never had the chance to investigate.
You have to take a class with Prof. Levin if you like music. You will learn more from him than any other person in the world.
Inspiring and useful; no-one interested in early music (or even not-so-early) should miss it. One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard, and it may well be the one from which I've learned the most.
Choose a topic that you think can teach you the most, not necessarily a topic with which you are already familiar.
An excellent class with an inspiring professor.
