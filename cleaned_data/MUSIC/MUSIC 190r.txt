If Technomusicology is offered again, you should take it regardless of whether it is an elective or not.
If you take this class, all your friends will be jealous of your lectures and homework.  Seriously.  It's so awesome you'll hardly believe it's a class were it not for the fact that the learning comes thick and fast too.
A truly dedicated and inspired teacher who is doing innovative things in the classroom -- well worth taking!
Incredible class. You learn the theory and practice of using technology to create and alter music. Assignments are all media projects. Wayne is the man. I hope Harvard continues this class and hires Wayne again!
TAKE IT. Worth the work -- you'll become a better dancer (no dance experience necessary, though it of course helps) and your writing will improve dramatically. I mean, who doesn't want to take a class where a large part of the work involves going out to dance?
If you are interested in issues around gender and sexuality, this course will allow you to explore those areas through music and dance.
