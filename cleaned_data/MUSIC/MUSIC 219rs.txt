one of the most stimulating, original, and useful courses I've ever taken; working with Professor Morrison has been a privilege
This was the most fascinating course I've ever taken. I already loved the course material, but Prof. Morrison made me see it in a totally new light.
Welcome to 21st century musicology.
It is extremely useful for understanding the complexities of scholarship on topics relating to media studies and multimedia works.
This course provides a wonderful way to combine interdisciplinary interests in music, film, and visual art.
take this class!
Great class, great professor.
This is a truly inclusive class that features scholarship and music by women, people of color, and immigrant communities, among many other groups.
