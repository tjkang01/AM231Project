This is an amazing class! Don't think that because there are only two students that that means that it is less amazing, or that the comments won't be representative of it. Agnes is a great professor and a great person. The material is great, the class is challenging but laid-back, and you will get much better at Swedish.
Maja's wonderful, she's very helpful and a small class is a great opportunity to get in a lot of speaking time!
The textbook the course utilizes is a bit unstructured, so be self-motivated and ready to put in a lot of work that is not "assigned" or required if you want to succeed and progress in the language.
If you took Swedish A and liked it, or if you know some Swedish already, this class is great! Ursula is smart and encourages participation and interest. Assignments are sometimes difficult, but always fun and extremely worthwhile. I learned a ton.
very engaging to your humanity, and a good break from mindless science classes.
A wonderful class!
