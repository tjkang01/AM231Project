My favorite course in my first year of graduate school.  Especially valuable for students that aren't already sure what they want to study.
That if they are not sure about what they are interested in within genetics, this is an extraordinary opportunity to find it.
This course was an excellent way to narrow down your interests and list of potential rotation labs!
It's a good class if you haven't found your second rotation lab.
This bootcamp is a great way to expose yourself to various model organisms used to study genetics. Free breakfast/lunch/sometimes dinner! Take advantage of this bootcamp to learn cool techniques and cool science!!
Its hard to understate how great this bootcamp was. Great introduction to many different labs and fields. The only complaint we really had was for more diversity for the free lunches
