I think that this course might be more helpful to take after having declared a thesis lab / having a defined research project, rather than as a first-year/rotating student. I think if I had taken the course later in my PhD, I would have a better sense for how I would potentially be able to apply these tools to my specific project.
This course provides a good overview of several useful online portals and tools (e.g., NCBI, Expasy, UCSC Genome Browser), along with an excellent primer on next-generation sequencing and related data analysis (a highlight of the course). The knowledge gained through the course will be useful in allowing you to more effectively access and analyse biological data.
