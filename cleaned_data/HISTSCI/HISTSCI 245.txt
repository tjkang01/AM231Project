It's an excellent course for understanding the construction of race in science and medicine in the U.S. as well as it was great for graduate students embarking on teaching to begin to develop their own style and ways for teaching difficult materials.
I would definitely recommend this class, but caution about how the division of undergrads/grads is. I might break up this course into all-undergrad and all-grad sections.
no feedback on assignments; strays from the syllabus
