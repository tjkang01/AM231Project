It was pretty good.It is a discussion-intensive class.Uncertainty is a really broad concept.  Some of the readings/weeks can feel pretty disconnected to others.  But each set of readings is interesting, and at times the topics do collide at times.  But there is no grand narrative running through the course to organize or animate it.For people familiar with history of science, I would note that this class is definitely closer to philosophy of science than most classes in the department.
