Even for those not really interested in anthropology, definitely take this class, Lemov is awesome and makes the material really interesting and engaging.
Come to class prepared to participate in discussion! The readings are really interesting and worthy of further thought, in a collective setting like a classroom.
This is an excellent course, with an excellent professor. It focuses on various technologies used throughout the history of anthropology, so don't expect a class on theory. Prof. Lemov is a fantastic, warm, helpful, engaging, and overall wonderful professor. Take it just for her if you don't know if you're interested in the subject!
Very interesting and Professor Lemov is awesome
This seminar is a very interesting exploration of the development of technologies in anthropology used to examine difference among people.  The class is a real treat for students prepared to analyze the readings and participate in deep discussions about the nature of human culture.
If you are interested, yes.  The class is taught very well, but it may not interest everyone
Even if you have no prior background or knowledge about anthropology, definitely take this course! The readings are interesting, the professor is very knowledgeable and engaging, and you will be introduced to themes that touch on many broader issues such as ethics, the interaction of science and politics, etc.
This class is quite laid-back on a week to week basis, with the great majority of stress coming from papers. That being said, the stress is usually generated from the students' time management practices.
