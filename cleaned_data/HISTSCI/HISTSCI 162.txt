Just be prepared to spend a lot of time digesting the reading and really think about it.
This class is truly inspiring. The readings are all awesome, by strong and prominent scholars and authors, and provide strong ideas highly relevant. In addition, the class is framed in such a way that everything is interdependent, so what you learn in one class can easily be applied to what you learn in even two months later. Also, the kind of intellectual stimulation this class provides is unbelievable; the discussions held are all deep, and Professor Voskuhl does a great job facilitating discussion and directs us to plausible directions to expand our thoughts without limiting our horizons. Take this class, it's extremely rewarding.
A fun, intellectually challenging course with a professor who cares: Does it get any better than this?!
The course is a good introduction to 18th century history of science.
Great advanced history of science course. But don't take it as an 'easy' fourth class. You need to do the reading!
This is a fabulous class, no matter what background you come from! I would highly recommend taking it.
I recommend taking the class and giving it time to improve past the first few lectures.
