The readings are very interesting and the course-load is very relaxed; it can be what you make of it
The professors are great and know a lot about what they concentrate in. There is good chemistry between them and this helps with the presentations and learning.
Take this class if you can! The subject matter is very interesting, there are a few museum visits, and the course helps you to understand cultural exchange.
This class is fine, but it becomes challenging because there are so many separate stories that are intertwined.  i often felt like I didn't know what historical period to anchor myself in.
This class was very interesting and did not require a lot of work. I genuinely enjoyed going to lecture and learning the material.
