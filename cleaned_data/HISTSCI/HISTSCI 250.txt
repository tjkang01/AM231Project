Great class!!!
This seminar ended up just having two students, which is always challenging for the professor, but Chin Jou did an awesome job of making the class engaging and interesting! the reading list is generally good things to read, although feels sometimes a bit repetitive. overall, i'm glad i took the class, and would recommend it! (especially to WGS concentrators looking for a hist of sci class, or hist of sci concentrators interested in delving into some feminist writing)
The course will really shock you in terms of how society today continues some of the same perceptions of women's bodies as in the past. It has really opened my eyes to realize how systemic views can frame women's bodies in a manner that is oppressing or even inhumane. The course work is sometimes rather large in readings but doable (as long as you don't leave them for the night before). The class is rather small and allows for a lot of discussion. Professor Jou is also an excellent facilitator of discussion and poses questions concerning the arguments of the readings, so be sure to do them!
