If you would like to hear very smart people discuss the future of society, this is a great opportunity to do just that. If you are looking for structured instruction or analytical frameworks, you should look elsewhere.
professors are not as involved as usually are in the college, but the material is dynamic and ever-interesting.
This course deals with a number of very interesting topics, and the professors are very interesting.  However, the course is unfocused, not particularly rigorous, and mostly student-led.
This class was one of my favorites at Harvard! I would highly recommend it to any student interested in the interesction between technology, art, law, and philosophy. Every topic was extremely interesting and wide-ranging, providing a comprehensive learning experience surrounding our digital selves.
I would highly recommend this course if your goal is to develop your own point of view on the material and to test ideas in a fertile environment. It's NOT a lecture course and the professors do not focus on 'delivering' knowledge in this way, although there were a few (wonderful) mini-lectures.
Great survey course in digital issues / issues in science and technology studies (STS). Material is interesting and greatly enriched by a varied community of students across all of Harvard's schools. The course *is* lacking in direction, however, and you might finish the course with an unclear picture of what the point actually was...
