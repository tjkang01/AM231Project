If this course is ever offered again, definitely take it. Professors are amazing and it is definitely something that you would only see at Harvard.
This is the most challenging and stimulating class in Harvard. It makes us understand the relation between us as humans and technologies and how we possibly navigate a 'new' world, mediated by computers and the Internet.
It is a bit disorganized and chaotic, but extremely interesting and informative. Because the course structure and content is so exploratory, sometimes it didn't work, but most of the time, it was very successful.
This is the most disorganized class I have ever taken at Harvard.
Interesting.  Vague and unstructured but that ended up making it more interesting and allowing students to focus more on what they loved.
