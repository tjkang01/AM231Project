This course provides an excellent opportunity to develop a meaningful  research paper Prof. Richardson is supportive and generous with her wide-ranging knowledge. This course will anyone seeking to better understand the links between past events and cutting-edge debates in genetics & society.
This course is not for the faint of heart or passingly interested. It is a DEEP dive into genetics and genomics. It can be incredibly rewarding but sometimes the narrow focus can grow tiresome. Great texts, smart peers, and really earnest professor made it worthwhile for me.
This class is a crash-course in genomics and postgenomics, including texts on the genomics of race and gender, bioinformatics, and epigenetics.
