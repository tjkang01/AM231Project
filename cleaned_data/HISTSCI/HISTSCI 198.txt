Prof Oreskes is an expert/leader in her field, and it was great getting to know her in a small seminar-style setting. The reading load is heavy but always interesting and worthwhile. There are only 2 papers but they're not graded easily. Always come prepared and don't be shy about participating in discussion.
The grading is not very transparent. The professor is wonderful but new to the department, so understandably there was a lag in the return of assignments. Be assured that this course will be improved and positively rigorous next year.
Both the course and the professor have been PHENOMENAL--this is easily one of the best classes I've taken in college. Professor Oreskes really knows how to drive a conversation, and is great about helping us lay all of the facts on the table about the readings so that we can really understand what each author is saying. I've thoroughly enjoyed the course material as well, and have learned so many fascinating things (and have taken such a critical look at them) that I feel like it's great conversation fodder in addition to being incredibly thought provoking.
