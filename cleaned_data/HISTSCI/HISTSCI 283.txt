This is one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard so far. We were a mix of students from many different departments, and the discussions we had were truly interdisciplinary. Matthew Hersch is a brilliant teacher who understands the concerns and needs of graduate students.  He managed to support each students' individual backgrounds and interests, and helped us to make the sources and methods of the history of technology most useful for our own research. Above all, the course convinced me that the history of technology is one of the most interesting and relevant areas of research at present. Anyone will benefit from taking this course.
You learn and develop invaluable skills for an academic career, the syllabus is very useful, the material is very engaging, and the professor is very enthusiastic.
I would recommend this class to any interested graduate student or higher level undergraduate who has a solid background in history of science as a discipline.  This class is a survey of history of technology as a field as much as it is a history of technologies, so you should definitely have some substantial interest in academia if you take this class.There's a lot of reading, but that's the case for any class like this.  The assignments are low-stress and academically helpful (b/c they are basically the work a graduate student might be doing anyway - detailed project proposals and book reviews).
