This is a truly unique class: the opportunity to learn about this much culture, history and real-world applications is rare.
Interesting material in an intimate seminar format.
If you are interested in learning about curation and exhibitions, this is a great opportunity to try it out.
The course combines academic readings with practical skills
Dr. Gauvin's excitement about the tangible history of science, technology, culture, and media is palpable, and his teaching style brings the challenges of representing that history in the museum sphere to life.
Take it! Great course - really interesting material - informs future visits to exhibits and collections at museums, etc.
Many classes aim to balance theory and practice, but this one actually does. The readings are focused around books rather than essays or papers. The writing assignments are useful and interesting. Prof. provides useful feedback on papers. Final is a practical application of theory through the creation of an exhibit which is challenging (lots of students working together on one project), but it is also very fun and rewarding if you are interesting in the chosen topic and exhibit work. If someone is looking for theory around curating or informal learning, this course does not explicitly cover that side of things. One of my favorite courses!
This course was an excellent examination of material culture. The first portion of the semester was broad in scope, with focused portions on diverse topics - blue jeans, coffee, medieval robots - but these themes were all tied together well under the banner of material culture. The experience of working on a museum exhibit as the final project was outstanding, and something I will never forget, and an opportunity I am thankful to have had. If you take this course, you won't regret (or forget) it.
