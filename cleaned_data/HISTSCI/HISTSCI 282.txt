Professor Csiszar is a wonderful instructor. He put a significant amount of time into the course, very carefully constructing the syllabus and readings (he sent a survey to all students to get individual requests for particular topics to cover and weeks we would like to lead discussion, and took this into consideration in assigning work and adjusting the syllabus). He leads great discussions while fostering an environment in which students take a leading role.
Professor Csiszar is outstanding! He does an excellent job facilitating class discussion. He does have very high expectations, but you will want to work hard in his class because it is incredibly rewarding.
Despite its fluid conception of "genre" (or even "knowledge" for that matter) this class has a good structure to think through some of the key questions in the process of knowledge production--how is knowledge communicated and how does meaning become fixed in a medium. Covering a wide array of scientific/knowledge areas as well as periods, even weeks I initially thought would be less relevant to my interests had something that I could take away into my own thinking, with the added bonus of providing a space to think about how one approaches their own sources and produces knowledge. I'd recommend taking this course relatively early on as it changes the way you might read and think of sources in other courses.
