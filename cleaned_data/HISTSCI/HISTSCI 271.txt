I really enjoyed this course.  I felt, though, that there were many instances when some of the other students had not done the reading.  I thus felt like what could have otherwise been a fruitful discussion dwindled because of the lack of engagement on the part of all class participants.  I wish there had been some sort of weekly writing assignment to make sure students came to class prepared with discussion points, and also to keep them honest about keeping up with the reading.
Great and super relavant discussions about todays data driven world.
