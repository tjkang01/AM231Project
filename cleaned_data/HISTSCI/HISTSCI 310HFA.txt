Salon was great this semester! The reading load is very manageable (100 pages per meeting), but you are expected to read all materials in detail. Liz did a great job facilitating a comfortable and supportive classroom environment.
required of all first-year phd students and MA students in HistSci
The Salon is an opportunity to think about the history of science as a discipline and to meet some of its more notable contemporary practitioners.
Necessary reading for professional development
This course is meant to introduce you to a department and a field. It is purposely designed to not introduce extra stress to your first year, and is largely an exercise in socialization.
The Salon is a wonderful place to learn about the landscape of the History of Science field. You meet the faculty of the department in a relaxed setting and can ask thoughtful questions about their research and career path. While it is a requirement, it is a fantastic and useful one.
Read the articles and bring in lots of talk points because the time usually is late and the class can seem long.
katy is a wonderful discussion leader... speaking to faculty about their work and more crucially their academic journeys is enlightening and helpful.
It is a requirement for AM and PhD students but a very enjoyable one.
Recommendation isn't really a real option here. But I would say, this, like most coursework means that you get out of it what you put into it.
A useful way to orient yourself in sometimes unfamiliar waters.
My only reservations would be that the course is really only meant for a subset of students.
This class was a wonderful way to become acquainted with the faculty in the department and have a chance to have an open Q&A with the faculty members. It was a very interesting and useful experience to learn about the  professor's experiences with review committees or publishing their first book, and their paths into the topic on which they currently research. A terrific course!
