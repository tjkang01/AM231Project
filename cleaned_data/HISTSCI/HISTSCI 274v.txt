No one teaches psychoanalysis in this school, and yet it's influence is felt all over the academy.  This was a really good starting place for me.  I now feel equipped enough to start dipping into the literature on my own (though I'd probably prefer some more direction!).
This is a great class, Professor Lunbeck is fantastic and the readings are really interesting.  Some background in Freud would be helpful but definitely not necessary.
