This is an excellent survey of the history of technology -- anyone wanting a better understanding of the ways in which technology has been viewed throughout history, the historiography of technology, and the social and political context that shaped it and was shaped by it, should take this class.
Everyone should take this course because we deal with technology every day of our lives and know very little about where it came from and how it interacts with other aspects of our lives (social, economic, political, etc.).  This course is fascinating in opening up all of the complexities of "technology"--essentials to be a responsible human being in the 21st century!
