From readings to assignments to class discussions and other exercises (e.g. listening to cells, excursion to an apiary for nonhuman sensing week, etc.) led by Professor Roosth, this course was engaging and stimulating.
I highly recommend this wonderful, playful romp through the sensorium and the roles played by the senses in the history of science, culture, and philosophy that draws from diverse readings. The readings can at times be difficult to grasp, but that's to a not insignificant extent the point of the class discussions.
