Very interesting lectures, sections are not so great.
The lectures are fantastic, but if you are not a philosophy-minded person, it might be difficult to get engaged in section sometimes. However, this is a very enjoyable class, and definitely sheds light on a subject that I had been taught incorrectly in my previous years of schooling!
get to know Professor Ragab
Fantastic lecturer, wonderful TF, very interesting readings, unique and ultimately enjoyable course structure
This class utilizes a very unique approach which allows students to conduct thorough studies while discovering and exploring specific areas of personal interest.  In terms of content, the course reveals the importance of cultural and historical context in discussing ideas and trends--a revelation which itself reveals both misconceptions in everyday discourse as well as unexpected historical connections.
Mostly easy, but make sure you work hard on the final project.
The staff are very helpful, but you have to seek them out.
A truly fascinating foray into the phenomenal ideas and contributions from a region much overlooked in modern, Western education.
