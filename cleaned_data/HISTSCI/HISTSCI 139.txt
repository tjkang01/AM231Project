The material can be difficult, but it's very interesting if you enjoy genomics and Richardson encourages you to engage with the work from any perspective you have. The assignments are equally diverse and flexible. A fantastic course from a fascinating young teacher.
Great class if you are interested in the history of genomics. Expectations in the class are reasonable, but you will need to do all the readings and put in the work. The assignments are doled in reasonable doses throughout the semester...just remember to keep up!
One of the most interesting courses I have taken in four years at Harvard!
It was really fun and a great way to learn more in depth about such a hyped scientific movement.
This class was a fascinating introduction into the social and cultural implications of genetics, and is a perfect crossover between the science and society of genomics and postgenomics. It convinced me to concentrate in History of Science.
Be ready to work hard. The texts are thorough and the concepts challenging. But the class is completely and absolutely worth it. Professor Richardson is an excellent teacher who really cares about her students and challenges them to think beyond conventional knowledge. I, for one, really appreciate the multidisciplinary perspective I took away from this course.
