This is a foundational course that anyone dealing with the modern era, really in any field, should take.
Approaching this course as an historical endeavor and not as a philosophical one is in my opinion very useful.
A solid course with an excellent instructor and good set of readings. You will likely walk away with far more questions than answers.
