This is a good seminar for people interested in scientific instruments who also have some knowledge in the physical sciences.  Simon Schaffer is a very interesting and important scholar in the history of science, so it is a nice experience to spend a semester learning all about his contributions.
I would highly recommend this class even for students who are not History of Science concentrators. The subject matter is thought-provoking and certainly challenging, but accessible for anyone who is interested in approaching a particular era through an inter-disciplinary lens - at the very least, it will be a rewarding experience that will help you to sharpen your analytical skills.
It was a great class where you learn a lot. Definitely a must-take in the Hist of Sci department before you graduate.
I would tell future students that this course provides an in-depth look at numerous periods of history, the state of science at the time, and how it may have impacted future developments, through the lens of scientific instruments. Instruments provide a way to examine the broader picture, and the significance of instruments, material culture, and tacit knowledge will become clear by the end of the course. This understanding will prove applicable in fields and classes beyond just this one.
Be sure to get your readings done early so you can talk about them with Professor Gauvin. The more you talk about the papers, the more they'll teach you. Also be sure to put a lot of time into the final project, it's a really cool experience!
