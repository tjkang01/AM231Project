If you would like to read some old, obscure, though not necessarily uninteresting, stuff, consider this course.
One of the most useful courses I've taken in my first year.
A useful survey/ background of the field of the history of science and important turning points in historiography.
This is a phenomenal course that all history of science grad students should take. It complements other courses really well, reaching back much further than most do to illustrate important developments in the field. The readings are diverse and incredibly illuminating about how science has been thought about over the last 100+ years. Professor Oreskes led rich, interesting discussions that made for a truly great course.
The title makes this course seem more obscure and academic than it is. This is really in many ways a course in how science has been thought of in the past century, its perceived purposes and characteristics. The readings are fascinating - stuff that you would never find on your own but which is really illuminating. Discussions can be unhelpful though, especially when only a fraction of the class has a history of science background.
Steven Shapin is a legend and ran the course in a particular way; future instructors will likely bring something quite different to the table
If you'd like to read some forgotten, yet essential, texts and engage in important, if rarely discussed, historiographical issues with a witty and extremely eloquent intellectual, (one of those rare ambulatory encyclopedias on campus), do venture into the course!!
There is a good reason why Shapin is a legend.
