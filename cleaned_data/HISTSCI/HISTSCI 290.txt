Take this class if you really want to rethink and challenge conventional exhibition practices.
This course presents a rare opportunity to focus on the arts of presenting of scholarship and to participate in multiple exciting collaborative processes.
Great production course. There are no other courses at Harvard in which you are given such freedom to deal with a Harvard Collection.
If you work well with your group and are interested in the subject matter you were assigned, this can be a very interesting and rewarding class. Still, it is disorganized and much of the learning you do will have be self-initiated, don't expect to learn that much in the classroom.
Be patient and get to know the department's curatorial staff early on in the process.
Great class led by two great minds. Be prepared though actually constructing an exhibit is tough stuff.
