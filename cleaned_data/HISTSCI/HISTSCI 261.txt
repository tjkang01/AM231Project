A great 'immersion' in STS. Get to read up-to-date ethnographies (some of them aren't even published in time).
Highly recommended. You will need to do the reading and take part in discussion, so it isn't a skate class, but the dynamic is friendly and welcoming and well worth the time.
That this course's presence in the Department of the History of Science evinces the strengths of interdisciplinary exposure that takes the interacting disciplines (history of science, anthropology of science) as fields with their own methods and priorities seriously.
The class is probably worth it to be forced to read the books alone.
