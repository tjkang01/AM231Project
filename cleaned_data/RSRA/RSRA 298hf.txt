The more you know about what you want to write your thesis on coming into the program, the better!
N/a; required course for MA program
So far, the course has provided a good overview of area studies research designs, research resources at Harvard, and a roadmap for formulating and submitting thesis ideas. It would be beneficial to take advantage of the course's resources and visit the professor during office hours, since it's never too early to formulate thesis ideas.
The course provides a lot of chances for preliminary thesis development, as well as opportunities for interaction with a wide range of faculty from different disciplines. Even though the course meets only once every two weeks, it is crucial for you to start thinking about your thesis topics early on, and I would suggest devoting a few hours each week in order to keep up with the course's progression. In other words, the class is well-structured and helpful, but like any other seminar that meets less often, you should take initiative in order to get the most out of what the course has to offer.
