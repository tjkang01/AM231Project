Would recommend if and only if experience with programming, course is better planned than it was this year, and interested in PK/PD with an eye toward drug development.
If they keep the matlab component, I would tell students that they should have some sort of coding or matlab experience before taking this class.
This course is worse than a waste of time, it's a tremendous disappointment.  Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics are important subjects with long histories and rich, rigorous science.  None of these will be touched on in the course, despite those being the specific objectives of this half of the semester.  Instead, rambling discussions on industrial drug development will give way to "workshops", in which students will present case summaries of industrial drug development (recommended sources for these presentations included Wikipedia, leading this student to feel that the whole enterprise was an exercise in the uninformed leading the blind).  At no point are pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics taught, except for a single lecture in which they're talked about by way of general reference--they are never made the subject of the lecture.  The computational/simulation side of the course, which was certainly appealing as a powerful tool in studying pharmacokinetics, would benefit greatly if it were not taught with the oft-repeated caveat that "I don't really know anything about pharmacology, I just know about MatLab".  Surely there is someone, perhaps in the Medical School, who knows both pharmacology and math; there certainly is at other graduate schools.
