I would recommend this course to someone who is going into this area of chemical biology.
It's not that bad.
Only take this course if you know nothing about small molecule drug discovery and want to learn.
If you're really interested in drug design, this is an okay class, but I have heard there are much better options. Otherwise, only take this course if it's required.
Good course for anyone interested in drug discovery.
