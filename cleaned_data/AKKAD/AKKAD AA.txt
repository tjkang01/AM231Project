This is an excellent class -- Gojko is an absolute beast in his subject and he's a pleasure to be in class with. By the end of the semester, you'll be shocked by how much progress you've made -- in just three months, you go from absolute zero to reading real tablets from Ancient Babylon and Assyria. Obviously, this is a very specialized course, so don't take it if you aren't interested in languages/linguistics/history/the Middle East, etc., but overall it's been one of the best and surprisingly least-stressful classes I've yet taken at Harvard
I would recommend this course with enthusiasm to anyone who wants to learn Akkadian. I would not recommend it, however, to someone who simply needs to fulfill a language requirement. It is a fascinating language, but it can be difficult for speakers of Indo-European languages (especially ones like English, that do not have a robust case system and lots of verbal inflection) to learn a Semitic language for the first time and to start learning how to read cuneiform script too.
If you are not a highly skilled language learner, I encourage you to take this course in a semester when it can be your primary focus.
