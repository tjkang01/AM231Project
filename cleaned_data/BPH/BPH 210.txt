Great course if you want to be exposed to pathophysiology but don't need to know it to the level of medical students.
Make sure to have the first quarter material under your belt. If you have a solid understanding of that material...you'll do fine on the other quarters.
study class notes - book can be used more as a reference.
It is what you make of it. It was enjoyable, but I didn't learn as much as I have in other classes.
This class affords students the opportunity for a nice review of pathophysiology with a well-briefed and entertaining professor.
Very thorough over view of major organ systems within body and diseases associated with each.
Good overview of pathogenesis - does not go too deep into any of the different systems but excellent class if you want to know about general pathogenesis - you still will need to memorize a substantial amount of knowledge!
Les is a great lecturer.  He keeps the lectures light (which is difficult when you're talking about cancers and abscesses all day), yet informative.  He has a great sense of humor and will keep your attention in lecture.  You will also learn a great deal about human disease and the study of pathology.
an excellent class!
Don't miss this class unless you are an MD.
Good class to skim the basics of pathophysiology with easy format of online lectures, helpful online text, and take-home exams
If the course is revamped, I would recommend it as the information is very important to learn. But otherwise, one can get the same out of reading the textbook
As someone who's eager to explore more sides of practicing medicine, I think this course helped me to see how diagnoses might normally be carried out by doctors. What was personally fascinating to see was the well-rounded consideration that goes into patient diagnoses, especially when given a complex set of symptoms, history, lab results, etc. that may or may not formulate together.
