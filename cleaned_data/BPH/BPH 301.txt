A great overview of ongoing research in the GCD, IID, MIPS and Nutrition departments.
The faculty presentations are more seminar-style than interactive.
Reading the papers beforehand would be helpful in order to best follow the presentations
Have an open mind about which labs you want to rotate in -- if you find a professor's lecture interesting, talk to them afterwards, and rotate with them if possible
It's awesome
Professor is great!
This class will casually broaden your understanding of public health research topics in the BPH department.
This course gives you a good overview of faculty research interests. It expands your thinking on what is basic research in a public health context. It opens up ideas for you to consider for your rotations and even thesis work.
It's not too much work and provides a good overview of different approaches to research in biological sciences in public health.
Definitely helpful but as it is a requirement, there is not much choice in the matter
This is a bit of a moot point as the course is a requirement, yet I would recommend the class to others completely.
Great opportunity to meet BPH faculty, ask them questions without reservation and hear them talk about their work
Participate!
It's gonna be really helpful in choosing your next rotation labs
Be ready to talk because you'll be graded on it!
