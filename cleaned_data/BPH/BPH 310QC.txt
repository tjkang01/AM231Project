Great class. Very informative.
This course gives a rich historical account of the different hypotheses for the mechanisms driving aging and age-related pathologies and facilitates stimulating discussion around key papers supporting or refuting each hypothesis.
Very thorough overview of the aging field.
The papers can be challenging, but the environment is non judgmental and you shouldn't feel embarrassed or nervous if you are less comfortable than your peers.
