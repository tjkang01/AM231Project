excellent reading course for all students. provides an important background in metabolic studies as well as pushes you to read, evaluate, and understand the experimental procedures thoroughly. chi-hao is amazing!
Reading academic papers is hard, and reading papers the right way is even harder. But this class will teach you how to read critically and not to accept everything at face value, even if it is published in Science/Nature/Cell. It is challenging, but ultimately rewarding, and your confidence in reading and presenting figures will increase dramatically over the semester.
