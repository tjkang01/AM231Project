Out of all the classes I've taken at Harvard, I enjoyed this one the most. It's obvious that Brendan put a lot of thought into the course in terms of lecture material and readings. I learned a lot about the field of cancer metabolism!
As a cancer biologist, it's critical to have some understanding of tumor metabolism.  This course is a great introduction to the field.
This course provided an outstanding introduction to the basic and complex principles of tumor cell signaling and metabolism. The lectures were phenomenal and will serve as a compendium that I will reference far into the future.
A great course which will challenge you
This was one of the best classes I have taken in graduate school. Dr. Manning facilitated excellent discussion; the lectures were great preparation for the readings and a nice introduction to the field.
The best course that I took this semester! Highly recommended.
This class is awesome. You will learn so much and get to interact with a true expert in the field. Brendan is knowledgable about a wide range of topics and has answers to almost all questions asked by students. This is one of the best classes I've ever taken.
This class is a great introduction to cancer metabolism, and if you are interested in cancer research it is a must take!
This is a difficult but highly informative course that absolutely benefits those interested in cellular metabolism and cancer
If your field of interest has anything to do with cancer, signaling, and/or metabolism, take this course!!!
