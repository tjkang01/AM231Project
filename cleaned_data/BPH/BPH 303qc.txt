Probably one of the best reading courses offered. Les is a fantastic person/professor!
Great course for working on presenting and critical reading skills.
Best class in critical reading of scientific literature.  Beats department journal clubs and another reading course I took.
Les is a great guide to the discussion in this class and gives good advice on how to improve your scientific talks.  This is largely a student-run discussion, however, so be prepared to talk.
Be ready to read and present a lot.
If one is taking the pathophys course as well, it makes sense to match it with this readings course. This course would also be good for someone who needs practice reading and analyzing papers. This is a great place to practice presentation skills.
you should do it
