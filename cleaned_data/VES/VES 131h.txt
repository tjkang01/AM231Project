This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. Halsey Rodman was a very dedicated and committed instructor, as was the teaching assistant Oliver Strand. They were always generous with their time, gave important feedback and went to great lengths to make available the resources students needed to work on their projects. The course departed from a fascinating question, at the crossroads between film and sculpture, which was developed through carefully chosen readings and films and through challenging and engaging discussions.
Bring your own opinions and ideas to this course.  They will be nurtured and expanded.  The crits are totally constructive.
This class was incredibly well-thought out and structured around an interesting and expansive set of materials. Discussions with Professor Rodman and Oliver, the TF, were thought-provoking and open, but always tied in some way back to our individual projects, so the material always felt applicable in some way. Individual consultations were filled with useful feedback on concepts as well as practical issues such as where to get materials and which materials would be best for the project vision. Highly recommend this class! Was one of the most stimulating courses of my college career.
must take! Regardless of background!  Teachers are so supportive and give such great feedback, and really generate enthusiasm about the material. I came in with no experience with any forms of art and now want to take more studio art classes!
As a VES senior, this was the best VES studio course I have ever taken (and I have taken... a lot). Making work was complemented by great readings and film screenings (seriously AWESOME list), which is often not the most successful in a studio class, but this class did it.
