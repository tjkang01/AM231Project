This class is one of the most fun I've taken. Alfred and Hans are great, and are always encouraging and helpful. Get ready to definitely put in some long hours and have plenty of extremely late nights the day before projects are due, however.
Go into this class with an open mind and be prepared to work hard and spend many hours on course assignments, but with the knowledge that the final project will be an extremely fulfilling culmination of the things you learned.
