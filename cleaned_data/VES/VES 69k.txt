Great course. Know who else will be taking the course and how serious they are about it. You don't *have* to like them so long as they're willing to put in just as much work as you are. Do you know video, sound, lighting, editing, or some other skill that might help with video-making? No? Well, invest a lot of time at the beginning of the term learning that  it will help you as the semester progresses. Make sure you have an idea for the final project  no need to have it at the beginning of the class, but it's not something I would advise putting off until you have to start working on it.
Kalup brings together a lot of wonderful pieces to watch and his work draws from sources that most modern artists do not care about. He is a very fascinating artist but as a teacher he does not give much guidance. To get a lot out of the class you have to take his directive to just make things with what you have at the moment. His most repeated directive was to make things without aiming for perfection and to make things without waiting for the perfect time. If you can produce work you are happy with in a studio setting with minimal guidance, then you should try to work with Kalup. He is a wonderful human being and will put fascinating pieces and people in front of you for you to access if you are motivated to.
