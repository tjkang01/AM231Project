This class is a must for anyone who is interested in discovering how art is being used world wide to empower individuals as well as groups and to jam the predictable flow of dominant cultural paradigms.
This class will open your mind if you really apply yourself.
How much I enjoyed the readings and topics and professor!
Carrie is an excellent teacher, and the material covered here can not be found elsewhere at Harvard.
This class is awesome!  It's interesting from week to week.
