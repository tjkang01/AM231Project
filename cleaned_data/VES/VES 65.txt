Because this course is solo project-based for the most part, and since the professor is good at advising, go for it.  But be prepared to wade through painful discussions about personal feelings and discovering oneself in last semester's gender politics course.
The class will depend a lot on who are the other people in the class! It is a class with substantial content (political things) so there are a lot of discussions.
This class was disorganized and the teacher had shifting and arbitrary expectations of the students.
Not to waste time fearing the unknown, and to push for mid-class tea breaks at Quincy house.
Prior experience in video or audio will give you a leg-up in this course and perhaps allow you to go further with projects than the student using a camera and microphone for the first time.
