About Steven and John: They're insightful, and they really know how to analyze art. Normally a 45 minute presentation about any sort of school work you do is a stressful thing, but they know how to talk about art with you and will make you understand what you've done.If you want to do nothing in this class, you will do nothing. Be inspired, create art.
The best VES course I've taken.
You learn a lot about film and it's a great way to work on projects you've always wanted to do.
Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime experience, though a very slow-moving course.
Best class I have taken at Harvard. Very different from the traditional class. Stephen and Matthew are a great team, they know how to talk about philosophy and art and the world in general. This class is about life, death, sexuality, tragedy and joy. It will extend you as a human being.
It helps you to believe in yourself and simply express your thoughts, interest and beliefs freely.
Stephen is such a great teacher, and Matthew is such a great ta.  this class is a fantastic opportunity to work on any creative project and receive really thoughtful feedback about it.
This course by far exceeded any expectations.  It was engaging, challenging, inspirational and educational.  One of the best courses I have completed during my time at Harvard.
