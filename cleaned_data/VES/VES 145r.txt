This course was incredibly interesting. The readings, I found, connected to a lot of other courses I was taking this semester. Deborah and Robert were helpful and pushed when necessary but really let us delve into our own projects and let us, for the most part, pursue the types of project and work we wanted.
Great professor and great readings, but less making of work than you think.
Had some AWESOME readings, was framed v. differently from all other VES classes I've taken.
