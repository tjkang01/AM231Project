It is a great format- an intimate setting, a wonderful passionate and intelligent professor and a really cool subject matter that you'll enjoy learning about.  I know I'll never forget what I learned.
Professor Mangawang is very warm and open and it's a great way to really learn about the French New Wave.
This is one of the most rewarding classes I have ever taken at Harvard, hands down.  Most of the credit goes to Mya for being such a wonderful instructor.
Great chance to watch the films of the French New Wave, but not necessarily to talk about them.
This is a very chill and fun class.  You get to watch great movies and talk about them.  How fun is that!
