I loved this course. Guy is really great, the films are great, and it's refreshing to have light discussions about these films, especially begins Guy brings a personal and emotional touch to the discussions that is typically (and unfortunately) left out of academia.
What if you can return to childhood with the same hindsight knowledge that you now have? Time-travel with Guy, Dan and the class back to childhoodyour own, the class's, various filmmakers across culture and time! Take Enchanted Cinema: the most personally meaningful course at Harvard.
Loved it.  Could have learned more, maybe, but I got a kick out of the films I saw.  Possibly the easiest class I've taken at Harvard.
Amazing Course. Take anything with Guy.
Fun and easy
Guy's a great professor and chooses super engaging films to screen. There're only two five pg papers and no final and there's a lot of freedom on what you can write - AMAZING.
This class was really awesome. It was a class focused on a feeling, specifically the feeling of enchantment that we experience during childhood. The films were sometimes only tenuously related to childhood, but they were all really great films. Guy is a wonderful professor and is extremely nice and knowledgeable. He won't be teaching studies next semester but I highly recommend taking one of his courses.
