A terrible class. Demands an enormous amount of time across two semesters and a summer that is not rewarded with substantial learning, largely as a result of the professor's indifference to teaching.
for those who are looking to improve their editing technique and are open to working in environment where constant feedback is given this course is a great step moving up from say intro to video. also having a body of footage to work from is really helpful
Best filmmaking class at Harvard.
