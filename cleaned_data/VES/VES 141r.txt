Great class where you can experiment with your craft. Don't worry about the technicalities of Time, Technology and whatever, there are ways to get by it in experiments.
Definitely take the class if you're interested in photography and art. Be prepared to do independent work, when at times you may feel unguided. That's fine. Embrace that factor as a great learning experience and go wit your gut.
This class was important to grow as an artist. One of the best parts of this class was the interaction we had between us as students and the professor really helped facilitate us exploring new areas of art making.
You should have at least introductory knowledge of photography - what an F-stop is, what shutters are and what the speed means, what "depth of field" means, what kind of camera you like using (digital or film, small or large, light or heavy, etc) so you can choose the correct equipment for your project work. And you should be ready to watch countless weird art films and historical footage, and enjoy it!
It was a challenging but interesting opportunity to come up with a wide range of ideas for the different projects. Initially I found it pretty difficult to generate ideas or to decide whether they were good or not, but I ended up beign relatively happy with each project at the end.
A very experimental class. If you're down for that I highly recommend it.
This was an engaging class that demanded a lot of students (in a good way-- it was challenging and encouraged good work) but it also required strong time management and deadline-setting skills.
For the right person, this is the perfect class to bridge together some very interesting types of media.
