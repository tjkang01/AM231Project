The intersection between painting and animation is a great place to be, and Matt is the perfect person to learn from. He's talented and smart and someone to look up to, which will make a lot of students work harder. On the other hand, he's a bit soft spoken, so people didn't take his deadlines seriously or anticipate being called out on not working, which was discouraging. I know there's another part of this survey to evaluate the professor, but in a class like this, if the student-teacher dynamic is off, and if people don't take it seriously, it's hard to grow artistically.
The instructors are great and very helpful!  You learna lot about art in general and how to interpret it =D
Although this class is titled "Animation," we do not only learn about animation techniques, but we learned painting, drawing, and story telling techniques as well.  The basic techniques of telling a narrative and having a series of images is helpful in any form of art.  Professor Saunders taught us how to really think about what our artwork would make the viewer feel and not focus so much on how it made us (the artist) feel.  We learned how to make our narrative clear and realized how our art and narrative can be interpreted in many ways.  We were allowed freedom to interpret the assignments and projects in our own style.
This class very loosely teaches animation in a more conceptual, studio based way. I was disappointed with the actual amount of animation we did... if you want to do any traditional animation chose a different VES class.
Great class with an awesome professor.
