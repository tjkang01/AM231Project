I didn't learn anything, and the feedback was very poor. Don't take this class.
Fun class that will change how you see film.
The films you watch are great but the class is disorganized and uninteresting.
This class was wonderful, even if you aren't a VES concentrator.  However, it took much more time to prepare for each week than expected (3 group presentations, 6 response papers, weekly movie screenings as well as readings)
Come with a love for film, leave with the technical vocabulary and critical viewpoint necessary to view films and appreciate them on a deeper level. Highly recommended for those who would like a broad overview of international art-house film.
This class is awesome!
This is a fantastic course which sparks lively discussions. Heavily based in student-led discourse, Prof. Bluher incites independent thinking. The thought-provoking nature of this course leads the students to strongly develop their analytical skills.
This class is a lot of work but at the same time you will be exposed to some amazing films. I feel like I learned to see films in a different way, and now experience them on a much deeper level. It is a big time commitment though, just be aware.  But film analysis can be really fun.
Try to get an early start with the final paper.
