LOVE this class. Love anything taught by Professor Killip. So much fun and so worth the time and energy.
Take this course because it's one of the only time's you'll have the chance to work directly with Chris Killip in a non-Intro to Photo setting.
A delightful class to be in: Chris is a gem. You really should take a class with him - not only to learn about how to improve your photographs, but also to learn about what it means to be a photographer.
Be prepared to spend most of your semester dedicated to pursuing and polishing one project.
The critiques are long and often tiresome but you will learn a lot and probably really enjoy yourself if you put the time in.
Very independent, not much help from professor or tf
Not an easy, fun class in the way that people want it to be!
