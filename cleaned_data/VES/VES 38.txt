come with an open mind
I would tell future students to be sure to enter into dialog with the teaching staff as soon as possible. Those discussions can really shape student work in a powerful way.
This class is a fantastic resource for the right person. I totally thrived in this environment and am so grateful for the opportunity to work with such talented people with such a huge skill set.
There is a great deal of self motivation. YOu will not be led. You get what you put in.
This was the best class I have taken at Harvard. It forced me to confront my own baggage, comfort, memory, and relationships. I developed strong connections to my classmates, was supported and challenged as an artist, student, and person, and deeply admired the instructors and their willingness to engage. For the most part, the class was thought-provoking and demanded almost constant consideration, but without stress of the typical academic kind. I think those who put in the most got the most out of it.
A great opportunity to express yourself without borders
This class is an opportunity to come out of your shell, experience some crazy stuff, and come out of it with a really broadened opinion of your own tastes, those of others, how people react to situations, and how to apply everything learned to improving your own artwork...and life in general.
