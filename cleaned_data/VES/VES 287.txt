Do not take a course with this professor. He just wants to control people and force his ideas down your throat.
Take it- it will open up the world of film to you.
Professor Rentschler is amazing, and incredibly intelligent. This class is so fun and interesting -- a must-take!!
Professor Rentschler facilitates wonderfully dynamic discussion on the various films under evaluation for the course. He carefully selects the films and accompanying literary pieces, and his depth and breadth of knowledge on relevant themes of the films challenges us all to do better. His open guidance with assignments during the course was extremely helpful. I completely enjoyed this course under his instruction! Highly recommend it.
