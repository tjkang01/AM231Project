Working with such thoughtful filmmakers and ethnographers as Alfred and Peter was a pleasure. I was amazed at the ambition--an introductory video class with a group project would be ambitious on one screen with two channels of sound, and to double this was really interesting and just really ambitious. The kind of focus required is of a different quality, it seems, though everyone did apply an attentive and critical eye or ear to each screen or speaker. The viewing and listening assignments were not only enjoyable but really interesting and inspiring, and the overall process felt rewarding and meaningful.
