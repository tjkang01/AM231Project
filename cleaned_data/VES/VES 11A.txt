This is an amazing class!! Katarina is awesome and Melissa is the most helpful TF ever!! They literally go out of their way to make sure that you are comfortable and happy while working, and their advice is on point!!
Very great class to explore architectural drawing and drawing techniques in general, for any subject matter. Assignments can be interpreted loosely to fit your own interests. Be prepared to spend a long time out of class working on projects to produce work up to Professor Burin's standards.
Great class to learn about architecture, a little art history, and fun drawing experience. You will need to spend a fair amount of time working on homework assignments, but it's a great class if you like drawing.
Great professor and TF, really enthusiastic and a super fun course to explore drawing skills.
Great class, maybe the best I've taken here.
A lot of time and dedication are necessary to get good results out of this class. Don't underestimate the time commitment.
