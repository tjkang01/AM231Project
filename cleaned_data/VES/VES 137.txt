This class is extremely rewarding and will definitely change your perspective about art and life. This really felt like a class I expected to take at Harvard.
This class is a MUST TAKE.  If you are interested in video art, performance, installation, and new genre/new waves then TAKE IT.  Jennifer is honestly an amazing artist but you wouldn't know it because she is really humble.  Great material to learn but also so much space to make what you want to make (with as much or little guidance as you want).
You should 100% take this class, be aware that it can be a lot of work but if you have the enthusiasm for it then it won't feel like work at all.
Get in and make work
Definitely take this course.
