a great opportunity to work through creative ideas and try things you never would otherwise. Jennifer is incredible.
!!!!! Yes !!!!
Jennifer is truly unbelievable she really made space for each of us to pursue the projects we care about and pushed us to make challenging and interesting work and prioritized making sure everyone got all the feedback they needed, which is so important in a studio class. We got close as a course and everyone was really invested in each others' work and it was such a joy to be a part of it.
