This class was a fascinating study of film through a somewhat interdisciplinary approach, by looking at film in conjunction with other aesthetic movements of the modernist period. I think the idea of exploring film as a means of understanding how modernity has redefined our understanding of space (especially through architecture) is a fascinating endeavor and one that can plausibly encompass a variety of disciplines, from philosophy, literature to architecture and painting.
A great, lowkey introduction to film studies and theory -- you get to see a bunch fun films and talk about them with a diverse group.
It really made me more open-minded and eager to appreciate architecture.
Excellent syllabus, films, and readings, somewhat disappointing classroom experience, total lack of interaction with the professor.
One of the best lecture experiences you will ever have.
