This is an interesting class, probably best if you really have a direction in  your work and know what you want. Experience with installation equipment is also a plus, though not necessary. The most valuable thing for me was the extensive feedback. Amie especially is insightful and constructively critical.
gave me a new appreciation for video/sound editing, it was way harder than i thought it would be!sometimes felt limited by lack of technological knowledge and it was difficult at times teaching myself how to use all the devices and programs available to us - tutorials were helpful introductions but learning how to uses these things really comes from practicesometimes it seems like you have alot of time to do a project but it is important to start it early and let it evolve over time, dont try to do it all at the last minutestart your projects early and get help from caitlin who is always willing to help if contacted in a timely matter
