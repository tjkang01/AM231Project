The most I've grown in my studio work in a single class! We were pushed really hard intellectually and artistically, and I feel more comfortable with conceptual art than I ever have. Huge time commitment and high expectations.
Fun class. got to explore varies of materials. lots of freedom to experiment and test concepts
