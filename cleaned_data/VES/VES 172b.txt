You have to stay on top of the workload but it's worth it in the end. Definitely a gratifying class.
Get ready to be postmodern
David Rodowick has forgotten more about the cinema than you are likely ever to know, but if you're brave enough to take the chance, he might give you a little bit of that wisdom.
professor rodowick is great, though you should prepare yourself for some seriously inane discussion among the students
Know a lot of theory beforehand
This is NOT an introduction to film theory class. It is in practice but some knowledge in how to tackle it will help make the first few weeks easier. Also, keeping up with the reading is a must, even more so than the films.
I really enjoyed this class. The readings and films were interesting and each week's thematic shift developed a deeper understanding of the concepts we were engaging with.
Take this class with enthusiasm and utilize it fully, don't take it without reading critically, or if you don't have the time to do more than skim through the very good readings and seriously watching the films - to do so would be a waste of an excellent class.
Take this class, it is a great class if you want a survey of modern film theory after Bazin etc.
