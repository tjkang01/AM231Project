Take this course.  There are very few opportunities to have such undivided attention from two professors who leads their respective fields.  It was a great experience.
This co-taught course struck an outstanding balance between the two instructor's individual strengths. Primary materials make up most of the assigned readings, and the filmography, an intriguing cross-section of Soviet cinema, develop stimulating discussion as the films build on each other over the semester. Weekly online posts, multiple rounds of discussion-facilitation, and 3 rounds of paper drafting made for a lot of (truly productive) work.
the class is an excellent introduction to early russian film theory, leads to excellent discussions of critical films
