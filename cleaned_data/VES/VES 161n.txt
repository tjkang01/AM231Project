This is a really amazing course. I learned so much about film and filmmaking. Every class was a trip. I feel very lucky to have taken this course.
Take this course if you want to produce experimental shorts and watch even more experimental, obscure films. The course has an extremely loose definition of desire and sometimes it seemed we just watched films because the professors liked them. There was little to no instruction on how to actually produce a short dealing with desire, rather the professors would just non-constructively critique everyone's work. The course does teach you a lot a about non-conventional filmmaking and it's definitely changed my own filmmaking. The highlight of the class was the TF, Joana Pimenta. She was brilliant and extremely enthusiastic and would help with literally any problem you may have.
