Any class with Athina will prove to be a great one. You'll learn a lot from her, although you might not realize it until afterwards when you've thoroughly self-examined. I recommend taking notes not because you'll use them for the assignments (you do one report that might take 2-3 hours to prepare and then one final project) but because you'll learn some truly interesting and fascinating things.
Take this if you want to watch awesome fiction films on amazing rare prints.
This was one of my favorite classes I've taken so far.
Furious Cinema was seriously one of my favorite classes in my college career. I really enjoyed the films we watched and always came out of every film screening incredibly reflective about what I just watched. Also Athina is incredibly amazing, and she has such interesting opinions about films that it's always a treat to hear her thoughts. This was a great class and basically convinced me to do a VES secondary, so I'm super happy that I was given the opportunity to take it!
If you like 1970s experimental films, this is the class for you.  If you're not that interested in the topic, the class discussions may not be enough to redeem this course.
Athina is amazing.  I would take any class of hers.
lowkey the best class offered
This class was very fun and you get to watch some extremely interesting, well, furious films that you most likely never have heard of before.
No work, fun movies, although it probably wont radically change how you view film.
One of the best classes I've taken during my time here. Should be required for all filmmakers- scratch that, all undergraduates!
Changes how you think about film, its history, its role as an art form. Deepens your understanding of art in a general sense, by introduction to highly specific works; the best thing such a class can accomplish, in other words.
