Enzo (TF) is phenomenal. Will learn an advanced skill set in a short period of time in section. He is also always available to meet with you one on one to help you master final cut or to just talk to you about your project. Amie (professor) will make you a better artist. Her suggestions are dead on. In addition, The class attracts an eclectic mix which makes critiques generally interesting.
the work we watch in this class is cool.  it is also good to pay attention to how you react to certain things and develop a sense of what you're interested in.
get to do your own thing, but a demanding class
Be prepared for some weird, weird, stuff. It's gonna rock though, just relax and let it go.
