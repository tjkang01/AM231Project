This is an incredible class that will only get better in future manifestations. The teaching staff was supportive, hard-working and very receptive to our comments/questions/problems - never before have my professors responded so quickly to emails. Also, the class touches on issues that walk the line between many fields (visual, anthropological, historical, etc.) and thus could appeal to a wide selection of participants. The class requires a lot of time, but it is well-worth it.
