it's a great ves class, especially if you're interested in sampling the department and maybe not trained in the fine arts of classical drawing or painting. it's one of the few classes that truly lets the individual follow their own interests and find their strengths.
one of the best courses ive taken at harvard
Be prepared to spend many hours in the studio. That said, it can be very relaxing and fun to work in an area outside of what you normally study.
Lots of freedom to do whatever you want, but be prepared to put in lots of time!
It's more work than you'd think.
This course is good for people interested in silkscreen artwork (ie non brushwork).
don't be lazy and do lots of research/preparation before coming to class
