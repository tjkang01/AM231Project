Great chance to pursue a conceptual photo idea
Unless you are excellent at accepting strong criticism of your work and little positive feedback and also maintain near-professional abilities with a camera as well as more than 20 hours per week to spend on your work, I would not suggest taking this course.
If you have an intrinsic interest in photography and a creative mind with at least one good idea beyond "I just like to take photograps" and a lot of time during the semester - take this course!!!!!!!!It is the best thing to improve your photographic work as well as creative ability (if there is such a thing).
A good class, slightly difficult.
difficult, impossible to please, harsh, not very enlightening
Get ready to have a lot of fun, but try and be thoughtful about your project and receptive to feedback. Don't take this course if you don't have a lot of time to work on your project.
My decision to recommend this course would depend largely on the instructor. That said, I think the class does help to broaden the way students think when working photographically.
The class was sweet, but at times I felt it lacked structure and as such I felt directionless in regard to the work I wanted to/was supposed to create.
