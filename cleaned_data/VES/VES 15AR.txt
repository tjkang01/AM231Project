great class, not too hard, just time consuming. Take it to learn a form of art that is hard to access outside of college!
It is a great class, hands on and technical.
Don't take this class unless you are prepared to do alot of work.
This is an amazing intro to studio work. It can take as much time as you're willing to give and will definitely change the way you look at art, as well as your own work. The professor is amazing, the medium is wonderful, and the possibilities are endless.
The class is fun but hard (time-consuming) and the teacher is great
