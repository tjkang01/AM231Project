This class lacked any drive or purpose. We watched a film once a week and attempted a half-hearted discussion the next day. There were only two assignment the whole term and they were both extremely vague and did not even relate to the course material. The professor and TF were both, on average, pretty inaccessible. The workload is very light but the course as a whole is unfulfilling.
