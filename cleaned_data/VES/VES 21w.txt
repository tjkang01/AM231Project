dont expect to do any thematic analysis, this class is all about representing objects as they appear
Since Roger is a visiting faculty member, I doubt this class will be offered again, but, in the case that it is, definitely take this class if you have even the slightest interest in painting!! Roger and Lily were so encouraging and insightful and definitely helped me improve my painting skills. But, be prepared to spend a lot of time and thought into the final project, at least six hours a week outside of class for three weeks, or if you procrastinate, multiple all nighters.
Roger is awesome! Such a chill class even though they expect you to produce a lot of good work, but it's very fun to be in the carpenter center just building your painting fundamentals. I liked how we just really focused on the technique and didn't try to be all metaphysical and produce weird deep meaning with our art, so crit wasn't pretentious at all the way it can be in some classes.
Time commitment. Engage with professor and TF as much as possible.
Do IT!!
For students interested in trying out the VES department while they are at Harvard -- do it! The resources are amazing, the professors are willing to work with you and you will get so much out of it. This class, like VES studio classes in general, is definitely not to be taken as an "easy" A; you will spend as much time working outside of class on your projects as you would on papers or psets, but it's a different kind of work that can be a refreshing change from other classes. My favorite class I've taken at Harvard so far.
As its title, the course focus on the observation, which is very inspiring for the students who is interested in fine arts and design.
Roger and Lily make a great team. Painting from life can be tricky for those who are starting off painting, but you learn quickly and figure out how to work with oil paint.
