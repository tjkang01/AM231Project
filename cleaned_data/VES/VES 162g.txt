This course was very interesting. Both professors are geniuses. However, I am recommending it with reservations, because I'm not sure it's the best way to learn about music or film. On the flip side, it's not the best way to advance your high understanding of music of film, which was my case  I didn't feel like I was pushed very hard. This basically requires extreme amounts of self-motivation; the course doesn't give you anything, but it has a lot of stuff, you must simply find it and use it. (Essentially a microcosmic example of Harvard.)
great class, have some ideas for your projects going in. Also be prepared to spend a lot of time outside of class on your projects.
