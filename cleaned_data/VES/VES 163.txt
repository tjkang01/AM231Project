the course was interesting but tedious at times
Godard is one of the most fascinating artists of the twentieth century. Learning about his work from the context of visual and conceptual art, and making art of your own in such an environment, is a unique and rewarding experience to say the least.
I think it's important to mention that this class has been both one of the most rewarding and the most difficult I have ever taken. The workload is that of two courses. The challenge was wonderful and irritating at the same time, but I am so glad to have taken the class.
