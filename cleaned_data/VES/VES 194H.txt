This class is amazing - unfortunately, it probably won't be offered again...but if it is, you should definitely take it. If you've seen a Cronenberg or Lynch film and were intrigued, this course is great. Prof. Hart is clearly really into the material and organizes super interesting and fun lectures with lots of fun facts. The course is a great size, and isn't too much work (only 4 assignments total, with blog posts each week).
This course was amazing. Awesome discussions. Very interesting film makers. Probably my favorite professor at Harvard.
Amazing class. If this is offered again definitely take it because these directors have amazing movies
A ton of fun. Not only will you learn more about the work of these two directors, but you'll learn how to think more critically about media in generally and see connections that you may have previously missed.
buy into the ideas of the course, and watch the movies carefully!
