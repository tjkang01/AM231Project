This course is brilliant and I highly advise you take it.  You need to be ready to really work on your pieces, but not to ever "finish" with them.  You will develop a practice if you haven't already, grow close with your peers, and also learn quite a lot about object-complicating and object-decentering artist and works.
take this course if you can! amazing course with enthusiastic and supportive instructors and so many resources to try new things out of your comfort zone.
