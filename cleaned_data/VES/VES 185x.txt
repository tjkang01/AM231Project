Professor Bruno has a very interesting way of looking at the world, of drawing connections between the visual arts, fashion, film, and architecture. She introduces her students to fascinating material that they would not otherwise encounter at Harvard. However, I sometimes felt that students were evaluated on the extent to which they bought into her particular worldview rather than on their ability to engage critically with it, to question the connections she makes.
This is one of my favorite courses I have taken. The intersection of film, fashion, architecture, and atmosphere is consistently fascinating. Professor Bruno is brilliant and has really created a unique field of theoretical study and a course that really gives a taste of that field. The texts and films are complicated and challenging, but also riveting. Never thought I would get the chance to take a course about fashion at Harvard.
Be prepared to do a lot of reading and learn a lot. This is a seminar, so it's up to you to decide how much you want to learn.
This class is extremely reading heavy and you HAVE to read everything. It is a demanding class, but it is extremely rewarding as well. If you are interested in fashion or theory of environments/space this class is unlike anything else at harvard.
