Great instructor, unique course!
This is an AMAZING class. I recommend it whole-heartedly. The lectures are long, yes, but they're pretty interesting and  a great intro into the world of conceptual art. Plus, the assignments given out were so interesting and actually really fun to do. I really wish I could take this class again. Definitely my favorite class at Harvard thus far.
I would highly recommend the course, but it takes some getting used to. First of all, you have unlimited freedom to realize your projects, which is both daunting and liberating. Even though there is no particular focus with respect to what you can do in the course, you have numerous opportunities to talk about your thought process, ask questions, and seek advice in general as to how you're approaching each assignment. Secondly, the labs were a bit frustrating to begin with because they didn't seem relevant to our readings or assignments, but each teaches you valuable skills that are often taken for granted or assumed to be self-taught (such as how to create labels for your work for a gallery setting, how to mount a painting on a wall, or how to document video projects). The class is really helpful in introducing contemporary artists and movements as well.
Lots of fun.
