there is a lot of theory, but try to bring up topics in discussion that show that you're trying to apply the contents of this course to living in the world.  i wish i had clarified more in discussions exactly what we were discussing and their ramifications for lived experiences and changing reality.  i found some of the discussions really interesting and challenging, but other times thought we got stuck on small points that ended up not being particularly useful, intellectually or politically.  though that's also a critique that we want theory to be useful... so there's that.
The emphasis on the class is very heavily rooted in theory-- be prepared to read some difficult texts.
Be prepared to struggle and not understand a lot of what you're reading in this course. But at the same time, be ready to learn from those struggles and be in conversation with your colleagues over them.
The texts are fascinating and the professor makes the work accessible and fun...take this class.
This class is very rewarding in some ways, but frustrating in others. I felt like I learned a lot in the course and was forced to stretch myself in order to grasp the concepts we discussed. The discussions can be lively and interesting, and unpacking the theory can be an exciting task. However, sometimes the class feels overwhelming and the conversations often become esoteric and ungrounded. I would recommend going to Professor Bernstein's office hours if you have questions or feel frustrated with the class.
Take this course if you'd like a feel of what the brink of a field looks like.
The readings were incredibly stimulating and will stay with me for the rest of my life; it's not to be taken lightly.
This is a really really fascinating course and has changed my thinking as well as my academic interests. Definitely take it if you get the chance!
Take this class if you want to read cutting edge queer theory and learn about current debates among scholars in that field.
