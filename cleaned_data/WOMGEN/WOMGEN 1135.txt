If you're at all interested in studying gender, sexuality, race, or ethnicity, you must take this course! This course taught me to critically engage with some of the most complex issues that are of interest to scholars across multiple disciplines, and I cannot imagine my undergraduate education without considering this course.
Great teacher, wonderful class! I learned a lot for my own research
