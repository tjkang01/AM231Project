If you have a chance to take a class with Mari, do it. She's fantastic.
Mari is a terrific teacher: challenging but fosters class discussion. The final paper is flexible enough in topic to be not-too-painful in execution at the end.
This is a flat-out incredible course. Professor Ruti is intense and driving. The reading list is enough to make your brain explode, sometimes in good ways, sometimes in catastrophic ways, but always in life-changing ways.
If you're looking to get a great exposure to modern theory then Mari Ruti is definitely the instructor for you.  The environment is fun, spontaneous, and thought provoking.
Mari is a terrific professor and the course and topics are very interesting
