The course is a great combination of history, media studies and women, gender and sexuality.
This class opens your eyes so much to issues that we don't normally discuss or think about, but that we should.
Do not be mislead by the description. This isn't as interesting as it sounds.
This class is enjoyable and doesn't require much preparation.
This class is really interesting, but it requires a lot more effort than you would anticipate. The midterm especially was brutal, and the draft for the final paper was due really early on, which might not be easy to do. That being said, the material is really interesting and class discussions are often very engaging.
If you are a first-year students interested in gender studies, this class is perfect for you. You are exposed to important texts that give you a language to describe gendered modern media/consumerist phenomena. Professor Light is really understanding and sympathetic; she will make sure that you have an enriching and engaging experience.
This class was wonderful! The topics were very contemporary and real. I could see the connections is my everyday life. Plus, Caroline is a wonderful professor
This class was an introduction into the effects of early and late capitalism on marginalized groups and the ongoing resistances that continue despite it.
It's a really fun class and you learn a ton about past attitudes and current attitudes about consumption. (Also, lots of cool vocab like "commodification") You really do have to think, and you must do the readings, and don't think that you can slack off. But it's worth every bit of effort because the discussions are amazing. I'm never going to watch a TV ad or look at a magazine or buy something, for that matter, the same way again.
It's incredibly instructive as well as interesting!
