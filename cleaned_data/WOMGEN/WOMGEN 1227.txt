cool class. Chiwen is great. It is a lot of work though.
Chiwen Bao is an excellent professor who is compassionate and understanding. If you are interested in discussing difficult subjects regarding oppression and intersectionality in a pertinent and applicable way, take this course!
This class was a life-changing experience for me, and allows you to understand the mechanisms by which inequalities are produced and also dismantled. The course content is relevant for students of all concentrations, to understand how our own every day practices can create inequalities, our own social position and how to be a more empathetic person. Dr. Bao is an amazing resource and mentor, so be sure to take any class you can with her at Harvard.
I hope this class is taught in the future. It is extremely insightful and applicable to a myriad of fields. It was not terribly challenging, but definitely extremely intellectually stimulating. If you have the chance or opportunity to take it, definitely consider it!
