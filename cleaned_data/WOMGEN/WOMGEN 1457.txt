This is a great class if you want to explore the ways that affects and feelings circulate on theoretically, as well as literally on this campus. I learned so much about how people and specifically I am bodily affected, and how these responses are connected to bigger social and power dynamics.
Great material--only take it if you're really interested in the topic and are ready for a bit of challenging theory. Ruti, though not likely to return, is fantastic.
Mari is incomparable as a pedagogue and as a person, and you will be hard-pressed to find courses like this at Harvard both in terms of subject matter and in terms of commitment to teaching. And I sure hope Harvard gets itself together and permanently hires faculty who do contemporary theory. This course gave me a vocabulary with which to express thoughts in my life that were previously unspeakable, and theoretical tools with which to make these thoughts meaningful. I'm truly truly grateful for this class, which, more than any other class at Harvard, opened up a whole new line of thinking for me.
Great theory class from a genius!
