This class was unlike anything I have every had the privilege to participate in before. The less you now about philosophy, French history, history of feminist theories and the academic world, the more you will be astounded and impressed. I really hope this course is offered again as it really changed my perspective on many aspects of my education and the theory behind the 'real life'. Be prepared to do reading and postings - it was definitely more work than I anticipated.
This is a really good class, particularly for those interested in the philosophical side of gender studies!
THIS CLASS IS ONE OF THE BEST CLASSES I HAVE TAKEN AT HARVARD. If you are even remotely interested in taking it, do it! If you are even remotely interested in feminism do it! The project at the end is really cool and one of the most meaningful projects you will ever create. Everyone needs to take this class. The reading is really interested and challenging but the professor makes it easy. This class made my entire time at Harvard worthwhile. You will not regret taking it, I promise!
