This course is phenomenal and introduces you to so many useful skills for academic work. The grant application process at the end of the course is eye-opening and is great practice for any student. The skills you learn in this course are applicable to any field and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
Take it. Just take this class.
This class is easily one of the best classes I've taken thus far at Harvard. The readings themselves aren't difficult (although there's a lot), but the analysis that Professor Luis extracts from each and every reading is inspiring. I've been told that during a Harvard undergraduate career, you find only a few classes that really change your worldview- no matter who you are, I think this is one of them. Take this class if you ever get the chance to!!!
Take this class!!! The syllabus is INCREDIBLE and professor Luis is AMAZING. If you have any sort of minor interest in anthropology, ethnography, feminism or anything that relates to applying theory to the real world, you should absolutely take this class. While the reading load can be a bit much at times, it is all well worth it. Professor Luis is absolutely wonderful and she makes the classroom an engaging, exciting place to be in. Seriously just take it, it will change your experience at Harvard.
