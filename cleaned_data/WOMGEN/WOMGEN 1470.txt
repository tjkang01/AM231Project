This class was very fun and very interesting but it helps to have a background in gender and sexuality studies.
This is an amazing course.
This course covers really interesting topics, but is also very rigorous. Discussions in class were incredibly interesting but also incredibly challenging.
If you feel comfortable talking about intense subjects in a way that isn't trauma-informed or sensitive to lived realities, and want to read works of gay white men almost exclusively, this class may be for you. The readings were interesting but left huge gaps.
This is the rare type of course that can challenge or change your worldviews, or the ways you make sense of yourself, others, and interpersonal relationships. I think it fueled how I approached things going on in my own life in a really productive way, and I feel like I'm more open-minded and have a greater understanding of the wide range of risks involved in different types of intimacies.
DO ALL THE READINGS!! THEY ARE WONDERFUL BOOKS.
If you ever get a chance to take a class with Professor Meadow, do. It's worth it.
