Obviously if you are going to write a WGS thesis, you need to take this class. But be careful about your selection of a tutor. You will work closely with them and if their style does not fit very well with yours, it may be hard to feel good about the course. Especially if you are taking the course off-cycle, I would recommend meeting with your tutor and with the head professor beforehand to get a feel for what they are like and what the class will be like, since you will have fewer (if any) student classmates to share the experience with. Also communicate early about how you are feeling and what you need in the course in terms of support, because it becomes very difficult to ask for it later. The heads of the department are also great resources for support in this class. All of that said, it provides a great opportunity to study something you are passionate about and to figure out whether or not you really want to write a thesis.
The class requires a large amount of individual self-discipline and preparation, as well as a commitment to your research topic. Our assignments were not given with much detail, but I appreciated the flexibility of the teaching staff, and their willingness to see my project develop as I had envisioned it.
