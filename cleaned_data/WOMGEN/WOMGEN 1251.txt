Amazing class. Given the fact that there are virtually no Asian-American themed classes at Harvard, this one was such a gem. I really looked forward to this class every week and I loved discussing such complicated topics with other students.
I thoroughly enjoyed my semester in this class. This was the only class I have ever been in that looked at the Asian American experience. I was exposed to readings that I might never have otherwise come across. The classroom was a supportive, fun space. The course definitely challenged my understandings of race, gender, and sexuality, and their overlap.
If you're looking for a course that will be enjoyable and that will also challenge you to think about gender and sexuality in Asian American culture, this is the course for you!
Rani is THE BESTTTTTTTT
Definitely a fun and informative class to talk about AA issues, read amazing AA authors, and expand one's worldview in terms of gender and sexuality in the AA community and beyond. Recommended for anyone hoping to delve into their AA identity more.
