Such an amazing class! It pushes you to think in new and exciting ways! When you think you have looked at something as much as you can, your fellow students and the professor encourage you think about it again in a new way! SO intellectually stimulating and great!
This is a fantastic course. If you have the proper background you should definitely take it.
A wonderful postcolonial literature course. Definitely take it! Professor Stanton is, by the way, awesome and incredibly thoughtful.
There are so many fantastic aspects of WGS 1236 that it's hard to isolate them and say: these are the defining reasons that you should take it. I don't, however, question that you should take it. Though not an intellectual walk in the park, it is so incredibly rewarding. It's definitely a contender for favorite class.
