It's a really challenging course in terms of the work load and the material, but it's also really rewarding and definitely worth taking.
The course is an amazing exploration of transgender issues and studies in the United States and Europe. Anyone interested in gender and sexuality should grapple with some of the issues that emerge from this course.
Only take if you have a solid idea about what you want to write your final paper on.
It's a lot of work but class is a great time!
