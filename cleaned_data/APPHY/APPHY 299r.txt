This is an excellent experience, it provides you with a "safe way" to a) see if you enjoy the work being done in the field of X b) see if professor X, and his group, are people you would enjoy working with and c) learn such information early on so that you can adjust your coursework and who you are working for to maximize your preparation in order to begin your research.  As of this writting, this course can be taken for SEAS credit, consequently, if it can be taken for credit, it should be a necessary component in the first year (especially because this experience can enhance your statement of purpose essay when applying for fellowships).
