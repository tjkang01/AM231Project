Prepare to work hard and to learn a lot!
This course is a must for condensed matter theorist.
This course was the perfect setting to discuss condensed matter physics at a higher level than solid state courses generally present, allowing us to probe research-relevant questions in a rigorous way.
A great introduction to many-body quantum mechanics, outlining the main approximatin techniques and models used for research.
Great introductory course on many body quantum mechanics, from second quantization and the Kubo formula to superconductivity and Feynmnan diagrams
Prepare to have fun with many-body physics!
This course will give you a broad perspective about many cornerstones of condensed matter physics, being helpful either to the student interested in research in condensed matter physics or to the student interested in acquiring a general background in physics.
Great class and you'd learn a lot. Just know going in that it is going to be a hard class.
This is a well organized course that will push up your mathematical ability and theorethical understanding in solid state materials.
This is a course that condensed matter theory students must take. Prof. Demler's notes and instruction in class were both excellent. There is a wide range of topics covered.
This is a great way to learn about some fascinating developments and puzzles in condensed matter physics. It will, of course, take a lot of effort.
