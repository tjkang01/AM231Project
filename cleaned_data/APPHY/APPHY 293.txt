The topics covered in the class should be interesting, but since the lectures are not clear enough, the classes are a little bit confusing.
If you are interested in materials science, take this course. Frans Spaepen is probably the best teacher you will find for this material, and the course is really interesting and fun.
Useful for crossover materials scientists/engineers who deal with both microscopic and macroscopic deformation phenomena, as the course deals with both.
It is a significant amount of work, less than AP282, but still a solid amount.  Do the homework and the notes from the class are the most important resource.
