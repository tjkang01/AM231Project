It was less of a survey course as I originally expected.  Could be called Fourier Optics and Microscopy.  Very useful as an elective for someone with relevant research, but not so much for a foundational course for optics track applied physicists.
This is a good course to get you up to speed on reading literature in the field of modern optics.
Material is interesting,
I really enjoyed all of the topics. It was a great survey into the field of modern optical and computational approaches to sub-resolution imaging, particularly in biology. It is a good introduction to critical reading of papers, and I now will probably continue reading papers in the field, or, at least, trying to keep up with the latest developments.
The discussion and presentation format of this class makes it much easier to really understand the qualitative and quantitative principles behind a variety of imaging techniques.  It also emphasizes critical consideration of work published in the literature; in this class I finally learned not to take reported results for granted as being correct, ever, which is something that is really important for scientific research.  I found this class really interesting, and I'm really glad I took it.
If you already have a good background in optics and are interested in imaging applications, then - this is the class for you. If you are trying to get an understanding of some of the issues in optics towards a better sense of the field as a whole, then - this course is probably not the best.
This class will teach you optics from first principles. You will learn so much about the basics and many optical imaging techniques. However, be prepared to put in substantial work.
Many examples in Biology may be useful if you are interested in it.
