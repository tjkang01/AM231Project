I would recommend it as a must-take for everyone seeking to understand the international component of economic policy.
Exams are harder than one would expect, but the material is interesting and the textbook is really helpful in understanding the material.
It's tough material, but well worth knowing.
Useful class to get a solid grounding in international ec but not the most interesting class you can find. Professor is super nice but gives lectures very similar to book, of which he is the author...
I'd recommend the class to people who would feel confident that they could think the way the tests require one to.
Unequivocally the best course I have taken at Harvard.
Great material to learn and will help you in the future no matter what field you choose. The professor is very brilliant and clearly explains the material over and over again.
If you're interested in international finance this is a good way to get your feet wet. However, it's hard to fit in with the rest of the kennedy school students.
Read the textbook
The material covered in the class is interesting and useful, but the classroom experience as a whole should dissuade students from taking the course if they are looking for memorable economics courses.
Make sure Marika isn't the TF before taking it.
I really enjoyed this class. Professor Gopinath is an excellent lecturer and discusses some of the important global financial issues today. She does a great job explaining the challenging material so go talk to her and take advantage of her office hours. It will help both for the in-class material and in applying it to what is going on around the world. Marika was also a great TF.
Great class, but a bit demanding and the person needs some macro background to grasp all the topics well.
The professor is very good
Good class for college students who have already taken 1010b. Teaches some concepts learned in 1010b in more detail.
