I think this class is a "must" at Harvard. I would strongly recommend this course to people interested in econometrics. Although it seems the material is specially tailored for applied econometricians, I think that anyone interested in econometric theory would love this course!
The material covered is very interesting, because it does everything through moment functions and connecting theory to data.
Good if you are an econometrician
