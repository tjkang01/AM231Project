The course topics are interested, but the lectures were not always worthwhile, and the case discussions were rarely enlightening
I think it is an important field to know, but I definitely recommend not taking this course with Bob Gibbons. He is the worse teacher I ever had. His lectures are basically ramblings over his "insights" on everything. Personally I found this "insights" totally incoherent, and I must say I did not learn anything at all from the many lectures from him I attended.Oliver Hart was fine though, so I would take this course with him.
it covers a large spectrum of issues in organizational issues and gives pointers for where to look if more interested in a particular area
The take-aways from this class are two-fold. First, it is an excellent introduction to the theory of organizational economics. But further, it's a great class for improving one's modeling skills. The emphasis on 'the art of constructing models' and the essay assignments have substantially improved my own abilities in this respect, and will no doubt serve me will in the future.
Organizational Economics is an odd field.  After a full semester of this stuff I am not quite sure I have actually learned something from the economic writing in this field.
