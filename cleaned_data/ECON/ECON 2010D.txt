Keep up with the lectures even though there is no midterm. This will be very helpful in preparing for the finals.
Topics are interesting.
You will need to collaborate with other students to gain a lot from the first half. Don't be fooled by the easy-going lectures - there is a lot more that you have to understand that is not covered there or in section.
If you're into macro do this, if not then don't
This course gives a fabulous macro/international foundation, so you can start appreciating the literature.
Farhi's part    : algebraically technical, unsatisfactory results.Rogoff's part : simpler models which gave me more insight. Very welcomed!
