It is a great class to learn about trade theories, but less a class to generate research ideas from. The focus of the class was a bit narrow.
This is a fantastic class. It's well taught - both Pol and Marc were fantastic - and you will get great exposure to the trade literature. It also builds on the first term in a very nice way.
Amazing course if you are interested in International Trade / Investment
