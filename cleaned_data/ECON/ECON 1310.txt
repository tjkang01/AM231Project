Unfortunately, Prof. Sicular is going back to Canada, so this class will not be offered in the future, but it's a great survey course of China's economic policies from 1940s - present. If you are looking for more economic modeling and development economics, then this is not the right course since models play a very minor role in the curriculum, which is more history-centered.
I had no previous knowledge of China's economic history or current affairs and I learned so much from this class. Perfect for China newbies like me.
good material on china.  not a super interesting class though in terms of time spent in class
It is a great class and you will learn a lot, but it requires a lot of work. The "midterm" is more akin to a final and the final paper can be demanding if you are not used to writing economic papers.
If you're genuinely interested in the subject, then you will definitely like the class. If the subject doesn't fascinate you though- it may get dull.
It was great in theory, but pretty boring in practice.  Low workload however.
