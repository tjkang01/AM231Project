Very interesting topics, but less empirically rigorous than hoped for.
It is a great opportunity to interact with a great mind
students have to be self-starters in doing readings after class to do well in this class
Alberto is wonderful and an institution. I really, really enjoyed being in class with him.
This is a very interesting class with a great deal of potential for providing research ideas.
Prepare more for the final paper. You would have to be pro-active in trying to reach out the instructor, and ask for direction/prompts for each work.
Its an interesting course for broader understanding and discussions on topics in political economics
Make sure you understand econometrics at an advanced level well enough before you enroll in this course.
This course gives you a fresh insight to use economic methods to many social topics including politics. I would recommend you to take it for fun and make you have broader interests.
Great class for getting broad overview on a number of interesting topics related to political economy
don't overestimate yourself
great way to get to know Alesina
Although the material is good and Professor Alesina is thoroughly engaged in the field, the lectures did not take full advantage of the opportunity.  There was also little debate amongst the students, although the topic would have been perhaps more engaging if debate had occurred.  Perhaps sections could be organized for this purpose.
Get started on the paper early.
Relatively light workload during the semester, but do not wait too long to get going on the final paper, as it counts for essentially everything.
