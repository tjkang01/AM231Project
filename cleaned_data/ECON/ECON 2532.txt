Great in-class discussion. The paper replication exercise was very useful. Would recommend this class with enthusiasm to anyone interested in macro and/or finance.
What you get out of it is proportional to what you put in. It is advisory to read papers before class.
This is a great class if you are interested in macro/finance, especially from an applied theory perspective.
