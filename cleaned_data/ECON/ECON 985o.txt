Basic thesis tutorial. Ricardo is very kind and helpful - try to get into his section if you can!
If you are writing an economics thesis or an applied math / ec thesis, TAKE THIS COURSE AND USE THE HELP OF YOUR TF AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE! It is so nice to be able to have a TF's support, especially when your professor doesn't really have the time to deal with basic questions of how to run tests, how to use stata code, where to start, ect.
It is helpful and great for thesis development
If you are thinking about taking this course, TAKE IT, especially if you are applied math and considering planning out your deadlines for yourself. Your TF is a great resource for all those stupid questions you don't want to ask your advisor, and the deadlines they give you alleviate your stress by A LOT in the spring semester.
The second half of the thesis tutorial - the main reason for the difficulty is simply the difficulty in writing a thesis. This course is beneficial in that it gives you another set of experienced eyes to help guide you through the process.
Write a thesis if you have a topic, method, or adviser that's interesting to you! If you start early, it's not really much more work than taking a hard technical class, and it is nice to have something to cap off your Harvard time in the economics departmentt
