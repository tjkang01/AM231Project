Great course with a small class size that focuses on interesting material from a mathematical standpoint that is not just doing derivatives as fast as possible. The course and the students who take it tend to be laid-back and therefore not competitive, which ruins most econ. courses. Understanding the material was key to this course, not simply memorization as is the case with every other econ. course I've ever taken here. If you like learning and not just fighting over grades with people you don't like, you'd like this course.
Be prepared to re-evaluate every decision you make in at least 3 new ways.  This class will change how you think about economics.
This is a great class. It's well structured, taught well and not very stressful. It's not stressful but it's not a pushover class, as the material is decently difficult, especially later in the semester. Very interesting material.
I would only recommend it as an easy class with an interesting premise but not enough flesh.
Only take if interested in the subject matter and willing to work hard and a lot on difficult problem sets.
Really interesting if you like theory! And the small class size was nice!
