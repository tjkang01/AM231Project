Primarily makes sense for students particularly interested in the topic.  But also some value for students of macro, trade, or finance.
This course will help you start research in international economics (ie practical for research).
This is a great class that will make you familiar with the various topics covered in international finance. It will make you familiar with open-economy DSGE modelling as used in academia and policy, as well as with some of the computational tools used by the community. Be ready to do a good deal of programming, and to invest some time in organizing the course material yourself.
The course gives a good overview of a growing field, focusing on cutting-edge research topics. The problem sets are very rewarding.
Very helpful for an overview of international macro. Covers both classics and latest research.
Take this class if you are interested in international or macro. Given the course's major focus, it should be titled international macroeconomics rather than international finance. Gita is an amazing teacher and you will learn a ton both from the lectures and from the psets.
Be aware that a better title for the class is International Macroeconomics. It's a time-consuming class which moves at a fast pace, but it's completely worth it.
This class was hard, but it was also the class that taught me the most thus far. You'd gain a lot of computational skills, as well as be presented with a solid review of frontier literature in international finance
