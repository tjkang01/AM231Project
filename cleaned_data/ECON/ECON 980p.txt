Overall a dry course; you will learn some international trade theory (around four weeks) and the rest of weeks are student presentations of papers (which sometimes aren't very good). Would recommend if you know what you want to get out of it--Helpman is super accessible outside of class, and will engage with you if you want to.
Don't take this unless you LOVE international trade policy, and love it so much that if you had the time, you would look up advanced papers on your own and read them --this is essentially what you do in the class, read papers on the topic. There isn't much 'teaching', so you'll only learn from the papers, which means that if you find them interesting, you'll learn a ton, and if you don't, you won't be sure what you got out of the semester. I loved one of the 4/5 main topics we studies, so I enjoyed about 3 classes when students were presenting on those papers, then I was bored the rest of the time. So look at the syllabus closely, and try to skim some of the readings before you pick the class. If you aren't interested enough to even skim them, you shouldn't take the class.
This is a very good class, if you are interested in trade policy. It is at its best when Professor Helpman is lecturing, but can drag when students are presenting papers. The whole semester is really dedicated toward the paper at the end. If you take the paper seriously and start early, the class is rewarding. If you wait, the end will be crunched and you aren't likely to get much out of the class.
