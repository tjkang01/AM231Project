Interesting coverage of the history that we might have overlooked. History is certainly not boring.
If you are a first year, this course will be a nice chance to read and discuss a variety of applied issues and broaden beyond the theory core (and the workload is flexible and generals-friendly).
Take the class if you are interested in the breadth of economic history content. It does not go overly deep into a given branch, so those looking for specific topics may not enjoy the course as much.
You will learn a lot. The weeks cover a lot of different topics, some of which you will find quite interesting and some of which you won't.
