best ec class i have taken at harvard. behavioral econ can take so many different forms. there were only two psets, and the rest was creating a project. great psets, great project with so many different options to explore. just great class.
This is a good chance to learn in a small class with a good professor about a cool and important subject. It's not particularly hard, though the research project is a good deal of work. This project can be very rewarding, though!
While slightly unorthodox due to the more lecture-based classes, it does still involve a lot of discussion and transitions very well into the classic "seminar" layout if anyone has questions about any of the slides. Tomasz is a super chill professor and is just as inquisitive if not more than you and your peers so all questions are great questions.
The material is interesting, and Tomasz is great.  I learned a lot and also enjoyed working through the design of an experiment for my final paper.
I think, as far as tutorials go, this was quite interesting. The research paper was very theoretical so was much easier to write than a data driven class. Tomasz is also a very nice guy, but is admittedly a boring lecturer. Tutorials in general are a great way to get through a writing requirement because they help you a lot along the way.
