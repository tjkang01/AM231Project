If Robert Barro is teaching this class, it will likely be a discussion / topics driven class oriented around some of his recent work. If Emmanuel Farhi is teaching, it will likely be a methods-driven macro class drawing on examples from public finance and fiscal policy.
The material is interesting, but given no assignments it is hard to learn it well, particularly when it comes to the unannounced exam.
Given the low level of effort from the faculty, it is not a great class. Some of the topics are interesting, but I wouldn't recommend it as a preparation for field exams.
While up to around a third of the class might be interesting to you, it's unlikely that you'll be interested in all topics. The course is too scattered.
Excellent class if you are interested in Macro. The cool thing is you get to learn from the people who really know the stuff very very well.
