Wonderful experience; not to be missed.
the course requires creative thinking on esoteric topics. but is well worth it.
ask questions in class. go to office hours
Interesting material, but the class is really what you make of it...
Professor Sen still has it!  Take this course for the material as well as for the entertaining stories.
Anybody interested in behavioral economics should definitely take this course
