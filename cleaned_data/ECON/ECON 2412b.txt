The readings were helpful and we got a unique perspective on the material.
The class was enjoyable - you will get most out of the class if you take the time to think critically about the papers and join in on the discussion during class. Push for your own views. Shleifer is funny and very smart, and spends a sizable portion of the class pushing his own views (look up Legal Origins Theory). The books chosen, in particular, were both insightful and inspiring for a future economist.
I wanted a course about Law and Economics, but instead this was mostly a course about Political Economy.
