I think the information presented in this course was really interesting. Since it was a new course, they were definitely still figuring out what topics to focus on and how hard to make the psets and midterms. Overall though, the teaching staff was really receptive to any feedback we had, and section and office hours were very helpful. I was taking CS50 concurrently, which made the programming components pretty difficult, but the programming component was a small enough portion that I don't think it negatively impacted my performance or understanding too much.
Be aware that comfort with linear algebra (Markov matrices) and comfort with some Stat 110 concepts will be assumed - this was not made clear as prerequisites in this first offering of the course. There were also many issues with surprise updates/fixes to problem sets just a day or two before submission, though this improved 2/3 of the way through the semester. Concepts were interesting, though classes were more proof-heavy (particularly at the beginning) than I had expected. The second offering of the course should be better; this first one was okay.
Networks introduced very interesting topics, and I really enjoyed learning about the material we covered and how they apply to real life. However, the course was not super well organized, and was very CS/coding heavy. Non-CS concentrators should be aware that it is more difficult to do well in this course without having taken some Computer Science courses beforehand.
CS background is very helpful. Or go to programming labs.
