Even if you don't think you will be doing behavioral research, taking this course can still be quite helpful.
This is a great class to take in the second year of the PhD. It really stimulates you to think about research ideas. Gautam is absolutely great.
I would recommend because the professor is excellent.
It is a nice introduction to the literature and helps you think about how to operationalize experiments in the field or lab. A good launch-pad for research
