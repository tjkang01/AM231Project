A great survey of important papers in macro. Gabe is great at working through the papers in class. However, this is not going to be a technical/methods-based field course though.
It covers a wide range of empirical macro topics, with many different subjects and methodologies, so it is useful to be exposed to it.
The course covered many topics at the frontier of current research in macroeconomics, and I would recommend it enthusiastically to anyone interested in the field.
Essential if you're interested in empirical macro.  Gabe is an excellent professor; very well-paced and understandable lectures.  Paul's lectures were equally great; very interesting and engaging.  Both were very helpful in terms of advice for the paper assignment.
