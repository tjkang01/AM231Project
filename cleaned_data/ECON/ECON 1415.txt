Beware of the stories, enrichment exercise.
Very entertaining and a great way to learn about how to think.
Do NOT take the course. The return on investment is close to zero. You will spend way too much time on the problem sets, and the tools and concepts the course presents you will have already learned in API 111/112. There is a 1.5 week section of behavioral stuff, but if you're really interested in that, take a class in behavior economics where you will learn more and have a better experience.
This has been my favorite class at HKS so far. It is definitely challenging, but it is a superb introduction to a range of analytic methods and to modelling in general. Its also fun! The lectures are really fun. The problem sets are hard and time-consuming, but you learn a LOT. I strongly recommend this class.
The one reason to take this class is to say you've taken a class with Richard Zeckhauser.  Don't expect to learn anything from him, however, but expect to do hundreds of hours of busywork that you may or may not know you have to do because it pops up out of the blue, unannounced.  Be prepared to be forced into groups that are assigned to you (groups, plural).  Be prepared to listen to stories that are not immediately (or ever) applicable to the things you are supposed to be learning.
The course imposes very structured and very difficult work and assignment requirements on top of a much less structured lecture format. Given your limited amount of time, the course itself is a critical ratios problem, requiring you to determine where you are most effective and devote the budget of time that you have available in that way. It's not for everyone.
Prof. Zeckhauser is an amazing man. You can learn a lot from him.
