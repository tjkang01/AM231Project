Interesting course which offers eye-opening material.
Not as easy as it seems to be.
This term may have been an anomaly, but things were very disorganized.
There was actually only one problem set, although the syllabus says there would be weekly problem set.
Very interesting material and great professor.  I would recommend this course solely as an elective.
