very rewarding if you can stay on top of *most* readings
Robinson is a great teacher, full of funny stories....won't ever fall asleep in the class.
-Great teacher (genuinely cares about the material; very open to challenges)-Addresses an issue that really matters - why are some countries rich and others poor?-Non-reductionist, interdisciplinary approach - economics, history, political science -Parity between content and technique
Take it if you want a new perspective on economic history and development economics.. Or take it if you are curious why everybody keeps talking about these stupid dead settlers long ago.. Robinson is very funny and knowledgeable.
if you're interested in developmental econ, this is a good course to take
If you have even the slightest interest in institutions and history: take this course.
Do the reading, start the paper early
