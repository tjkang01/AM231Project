I would take this course only have you have at least a working knowledge of econometrics - else most of the papers and discussion may be hard to follow
This class provides a lot of value. You only spend about 6 hours a week on it, but it is time well spent reading and analyzing papers.
Great exposure to environmental research. The memos can be surprisingly time-consuming.
