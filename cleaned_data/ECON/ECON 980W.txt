This is a great class for anyone interested in health policy or industrial organization. Professor Pakes and Luca are both incredibly smart and great at leading good class discussions on the topic of the week. The readings were always interesting and help you get better at critically analyzing economic methodology, while still providing a solid background in how different US health care markets work. The workload is also extremely doable. Would highly recommend!
This is a great analysis of the health care industry and details about the health care system
The small seminar style of this class is a great way to learn about health care and health policy, if these are topics that interest you. The readings are not easy, but the in-class presentations and explanations really help you understand them. Do the readings! It will make class a lot more interesting and useful
This is a great class in terms of the information you learn about the industry but does not give much direction. Be sure to take initiative and start writing your papers EARLY or else you'll find yourself writing everything the night before it's due. This semester we had 2 critical reading papers (5-10 pages) which was a very manageable amount.
You get out of this course what you put into it. You can do all of the readings or only half of them if you want but if you put in the time to focus on the readings, your presentations, and your peers' presentations you will enjoy the course a lot.
