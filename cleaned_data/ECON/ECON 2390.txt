Check who teaches your lectures. In our year, Michael Kremer was great, Prof. Townsend's lectures were good, but -- at least for me -- the remainder of the lectures was rather disappointing. Make sure you have covered enough of the prereqs
Good introduction to development economics
The course provides a good overview of the field, but it is a bit outdated.  If you are looking to have a good overview of the literature and baseline knowledge, this course is good for that.  But I think it is less good for learning about the direction of the field and thinking about future research topics.
