Very challenging, but assignments are very tailored to teaching relevant skills for an academicYou need to have a lot of skills coming into the class; if you don't, you will struggle, and there will not be much support
Great challenge but worth it.
The class can be time consuming but the emphasis on developing useful skills - whether programming or writing reviews - makes it very worthwhile. Excellent overview of recent work in political economy.
A good introduction to economic development
This class is best for self-motivated students -- the paper selection and readings are top notch, but you will really get the most out of it if you can commit to reading everything. The problem sets use a lot of tools you may use in future papers and seem useful. I would recommend!
Melissa is a spectacular teacher and researcher - if you have the opportunity to take a class with her, don't pass it up.
