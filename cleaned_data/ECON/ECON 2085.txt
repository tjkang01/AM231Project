This course provides all the tools you will probably ever need to conceptualize and measure income inequality and poverty.  It does not provide them on a plate, however, and some serious wrangling with the readings and presentations is needed to get the most out of the class.  The workload is very light if you do no readings; quite heavy if you do them all.
The lecture format is dry, but the overall topic matter is fascinating. More group projects or papers might make the course more fulfilling.

I think you can always learn new and interesting things from Prof Sen, and Prof Atkinson is a wealth of knowledge and fantastic person to boot. This was an enjoyable class that never fully came together.
Sen and Atkinson are incredible academics but neither is a very good lecturer and the course is not that interesting.
