Awesome
Once in a lifetime experience. This is the kind of class that makes Harvard great.
Social choice is a very cool field. It blends economics and philosophy in a really unique way, and you leave the class really feeling like there's a lot of work to be done, both with very heady theory concepts and in practical implementation and empirics.
The lectures could be very interesting, but tended to focus on details (particularly Maskin's parts) without creating a cohesive picture. The minute details of case-work (which at any rate are less interesting than learning about results and techniques and surveying a terrain. The organization of the course, however, was rather poor. I learned more writing the final paper than I did in the other general swatches of the course (which covered very little meaningfully). The course also failed to explain why anyone should care about social choice as a field of economics today (seems like it has faded in importance since the 80s) and whether there is any worthwhile research to be done there. This seems like a basic expectation it should have met.
A great chance to learn a cool topic in economics with great professors.
This isn't a class that develops a general, systematic framework for social choice theory. It presents some select results, discusses a few topics, but these are like bonuses for somebody who is already familiar with the material, or doing a lot of reading outside of class. You won't get much out if you don't put much in. There isn't a whole lot of guidance on the final project, but I didn't find that to be much of a problem.
As a grad course, it requires a substantial commitment to independently following up on the work.
