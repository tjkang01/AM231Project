It is extremely theoretical, so you should only take it if you are interested in economic theory.  It isn't as relevant for public policy PhD students who are interested in applied economics.
This is a great class. The readings are really good, so its an excellent, comprehensive introduction to environmental and natural resource economics.
Follow in the book, read around the subject, and go to class with questions.
Take it - it is everything that a graduate course should be, and nothing that it shouldn't be.
One of the best environmental econ courses you can take.
Do the readings ahead of time, come to class with questions, and don't expect to have all the answers on hand. This is sort of the frontier of environmental economics.
Probably you need to be lucky to have a chance to take the course with Professor Weitzman.
A superb course for anyone interested in environmental economics - challenging, and very theoretical, but worth it.
