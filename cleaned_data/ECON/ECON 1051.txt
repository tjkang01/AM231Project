Find a group to work on problem sets with. Find extra problems to practice.
A good introduction and relatively easy, but people really interested in game theory would probably prefer Ec 1052 instead.
A lot of the economics courses we take at Harvard draws upon game theory.  Taking this course will help students understand many of the economic concepts covered in microeconomics and psychology better.
This is a good basic introduction to Game Theory but won't leave you with a thorough understanding of it.
Make sure there's a different section leader...one who isn't incompetent.
You will have to work a lot on your own and try to understand the methods and problems, because the content dealt with in class is a lot easier than what you need for the problem sets and exams.
If you aren't good at microeconomics (1010a) or Math 1a then don't take this course, unless you are taking it pass/fail.
Can be frustrating.
It's painless and easy.  10 weekly problem sets, a midterm, and a final - that's all.  And the exams weren't even that bad.  I recommend it to anyone who's interested in basic, non-theoretical game theory and to any economics concentrators looking for a not-too-hard concentration class.
very interesting but lacks structure
While in-class examples are helpful, you basically self-teach
It is misleading. The difficulty of what is taught in class is in no way indicative of the difficulty of the assignments and exams.
enthusiastic, easygoing professor, great intro to game theory. course is very organized.
--Great professor--Interesting lectures-- Too many problem sets-- Few resources to help you if you have a question, though
