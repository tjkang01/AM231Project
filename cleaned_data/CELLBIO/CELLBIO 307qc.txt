If you are interested in chromatin biology, this course provides you with the superb opportunity to interact with amazing faculty, who are very knowledgable about the topics because they work on them. Lectures cover general topics in chromatin biology, while the discussion sessions allows you to discuss, in a very personal way, seminal papers in the chromatin field with the senior author behind them. This is a luxury, seldomly encountered.
Relatively low pressure environment and easy way to get a guided tour of the field of chromatin dynamics.
Great way to flash-meet with successful Harvard affiliated faculty members working in chromatin biology field. I would recommend for G1s to take it to hear their studies from first hand to decide on a potential rotation.
A rare introduction to epigenetics and chromatin dynamics. It is also a very flexible class, which made it possible to take this course on top of a very heavy workload and many experiments
