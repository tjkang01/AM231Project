This was a very good class, great environment, great food. A nice overview of cancer epidemiology and pathology.
If you want to do cancer research it is important to know the topics covered in this course, and you usually don't hear them anywhere else unless you have a clinical background.
This course is a gem.  A small class with excellent instructors and hands-on labs allows you to explore an area of cancer biology you might not get to experience otherwise.
