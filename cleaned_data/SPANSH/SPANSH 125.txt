This class was honestly my favorite of this term. Professor Gaylord and Elizabeth are amazing at making you feel excited and engaged with the material (and honestly, who couldn't love Cervantes?). My Spanish improved so much because Professor Gaylord really encouraged participation, so I felt comfortable speaking up, even though my Spanish is far from fluent. I highly recommend this course.
It's a great course concerning the golden age of spanish literature. highly recommended!
One of my favorite parts about this class was how customized it was to our group. Professor Gaylord made sure that each student was free to explore his or her particular interests within the frame of Spanish short fiction.
You must put in a lot of time for the essays.
Exploring the Novelas Ejemplares is fascinating, and this course does it in a manageable but interesting way.
