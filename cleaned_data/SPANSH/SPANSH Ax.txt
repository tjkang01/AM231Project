it is extremely labor intensive, and as graduate students, we are already have enough labor intensive work that a very intro course with this much work may need to be reconsidered.
the course enhances reading skills and is best suited for those who wish to conduct research in Spanish.
excellent course to take for language requirements.
I took this course because I had to pass a departmental translation exam in Spanish; at the end of this course I took the exam and passed. This course definitely, definitely was really useful for me in terms of preparing for and passing this exam.
Try to get Glenda Quinonez as an instructor! She is enthusiastic, creative and will try many approaches to be sure the students are "getting" the material.
if you know Spanish even a little, TAKE THIS CLASS!!!!
This class is a good way to prepare for Spanish translation exams.
This course is a challenging and enjoyable step toward mastery of the Spanish language!
If you want to learn to read Spanish for a language test -- take it, it was great!
If you are preparing to take the Spanish reading exam, this is the perfect course.
It is an swesome class and profesora Quinonez is the best!
This course was wonderful for graduate students filling a language requirement or preparing for their departmental language translation exams or for undergraduates who want to be able to read and translate texts.  It is geared for this purpose, though, so don't take it unless you have a specific reason.  Glenda was great.
be prepared to work hard!
