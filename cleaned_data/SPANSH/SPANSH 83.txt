Very interesting course that allows students to engage with Spanish in a variety of ways.
You've got to want to take a class about Spain and Spain specifically, which is somewhat a niche area of study but is what made all of the students in the class able to handle the narrow focus.
Great class, feels balanced, and very current and useful
