Great course!
This is a good foundational course to have if you will be working with the Spanish language.  However, be willing to put in the time to do the readings because they build on each ohter.
It is a fun class.
This class is very important for our area of study; it is also a good chance to build a critical position on the characteristic ethnocentrism of hispanism.
Low workload, interesting topic, excellent professor
That they'll learn a lot but that they have to motivate themselves very much because there are no tests or assignments holding an axe over their heads.
Professor Giron Negron is one of the most genuine and smartest professors I have ever had. You can tell how much he loves what he is teaching and it's amazing to be able to learn from him. Make sure to do the readings as it will help reinforce the concepts learned in class.
There's a lot you need to know to start this class, Spanish, maybe Latin, but the class itself isn't too hard.  And it's so much fun!
If you do not speak an excellent Spanish, do not take this course.
Fascinating class if you have any interest in the topic - good even for undergrads who are not native spanish speakers.
There requirements are a mid-term and a final exam, which are not very onerous (i.e. there are no weekly response papers to submit)
I understand many people fear or find this subject matter uninteresting. I think it was presented with great enthusiasm and the class itself was fun.
