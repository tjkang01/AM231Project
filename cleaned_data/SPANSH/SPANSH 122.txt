This course is a great way to understand the Spanish conquest but at the same time, political problems of our western present.
The subject focus of this class is very specific so only take it if you really think you're going to love reading again and again about the Spanish conquest and the economic backing of the explorers. You should also be aware that there are many long readings each week (and a short response paper to do based on the readings) and many are in an early form of Spanish that can be very difficult to read, especially if Spanish is not your first language.
Had a bunch of fun learning about and debating the intricacies of thought before, during, and after the invasion of the new world.
