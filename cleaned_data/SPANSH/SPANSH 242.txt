Take this class! It is amazing! Mayra facilitates great discussions, is supportive of all viewpoints, and created a great syllabus that really goes together and grows.
be ready to be transformed by Professor Rivera and the readings presented.
This was one of the three best classes I've taken at Harvard, if not the best. If you feel a connection between philosophy and poetics, if you want exposure to some RAD Latin American theorists and writers, or if you want to think about the colonial divide and how it lives on today, take this course! Even if none of those things apply, at least shop this course and peep the incredible syllabus. Mayra is SO smart and so kind and funny, too!
