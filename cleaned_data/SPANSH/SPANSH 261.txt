Any class with Prof. Siskind is going to be an amazing, unpredictable, yet fun ride. Take whatever class you can with him; you won't regret it. (Unless you're looking for a very structured class; he goes on rants every few minutes, which are the best part in my opinion, and class will never end when it's supposed to.)
Charismatic professor who is an expert in Latin American literature. Flexible class with interesting discussions on some philosophical yet literature based questions.
A wonderful and inspiring course, with lively discussions in class and a great atmosphere.
Great class. Super chill. Mariano is awesome. Only work during semester is reading which you should do and a final 10 page paper where you can really do what you want.
