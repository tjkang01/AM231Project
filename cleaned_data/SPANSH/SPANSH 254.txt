One of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. The course provides important coverage of canonical works and critical theory, which makes the study of lesser-known artists even more accessible (as we have a context to contrast their work, or place them in dialogue, with). Prof. Garca-Pea asks interesting and complex questions (both overarching for the course and to guide study of specific texts). She is attentive to students' interest, engagement with the texts, and previous knowledge (supplementing where she feels necessary). She has high expectations of her students, but in such a way that encourages excellence and development; it was a real pleasure to work with her, and I'll jump at the opportunity to take another of her classes. For the combination of interesting subject matter and an excellent instructor, I recommend the course heartily.
