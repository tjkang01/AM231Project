Professor Oteiza is AMAZING. He is an extremely cultured guy with a passion for the arts in the broadest sense who happens to specialize in poetry. His classes are focused on poetry and on close readings, but he will constantly draw connections on the arts, cinema, narrative literature, testimony, you name it. Taking classes with him was an excellent experience I hope to repeat in the future.
DANIEL IS INCREDIBLE, clear expert on the subject who makes it approachable for you
A great course, with a wonderful selection of materials (both of poetry and theory) and a good discussion fueled by difficult yet inspiring questions.
