It was a very intimate setting and the professor is very accessible. Great opportunity to deeply explore a single, seminal work in Spanish literature.
There is no way to know better the spanish language.
Do not be intimidated by the epic material, small size, or dazzling talent of the professor. Spanish 120 is a fine, nurturing, and fulfilling experience for the student of Spanish at Harvard.
