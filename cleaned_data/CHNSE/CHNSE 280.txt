Liu Laoshi is an impressive teacher, the perfect person to learn pedagogy from!
Take the course only if you want to teach Chinese
Fabulous course! Love it! It gives you concrete and real things to prepare you to be a Chinese language instructor.
This class is an opportunity to experiment with different teaching styles and hone your skills as a CFL teacher
If you are interested in TCFL or would like to pursue jobs on language teaching, you should definitely take this course. Chinese 280 is among a few, if any, courses across the university that exactly teaches students how to teach and is an absolutely amazing course that might end you up with a job offer!
I highly recommend this class for anyone interested in teaching Chinese at college level. The hands-on experiences are very valuable and Jennifer brought to class rich teaching experiences and multi[le perspectives.
If you want to get a big picture of all the possible methodologies behind the teaching of Chinese language, if you want to start building your teaching portfolio for your future job hunting, if you want to try teach the first Chinese language class, select this course.
The course is extremely helpful for those who would like to work as a Chinese teacher. The assignments help establish your professional portfolio. Definitely a good course.
