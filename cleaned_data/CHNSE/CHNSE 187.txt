Fabulous class. Really amazing to have a class like this taught in Chinese, so if you think you're up for the challenge (because it's certainly difficult, albeit worth the time and work put into it), take this class. Prof. Tian is incredible and really knowledgeable, and your entire perception of China and the Cultural Rev will be changed after completing the course. I feel not only more informed about the incidents of (and art and violence contained within) the CR, but also have a more objective and critical view of events, people, etc.
Difficult readings, but not many assignments. Interesting teacher but be prepared for hard midterm and project.
If you know Chinese and would like to learn about the Cultural Revolution, this is a GREAT class.
This class is a great opportunity to actually put the Chinese you've learned into action.
It's hard but you will love it
It's a very interesting look into the Cultural Revolution from a cultural prospective, not a political one.
It is absolutely fantastic.
