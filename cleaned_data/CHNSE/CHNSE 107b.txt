Be prepared and open to read classical chinese texts of genres unrelated to your own research.
This course is vital for any student who wishes to concentrate on Chinese literature, history or culture, regardless of the time period.
Who *wouldn't* want to read about Daoist lady immortals slaying water serpents, and emperors apologizing for their lackluster rule?
You will learn a lot about classical China, not just the language.
This is a laid-back, effective, and fun course in classical Chinese.
This is a straight-ahean, no-nonsense language class. You can't argue with the results: I was able to use the language in research, with a little assistance from the instructor.
More practice reading literary Chinese is always useful for anyone who works on pre-20th Century China, Korea, or Japan, and gaining that practice in a somewhat more formal setting is valuable as it provides more opportunity to have mistakes corrected.
If you are taking this class as a requirement then try to see if there is anything else you can take. This last semester adds very little to the knowledge gained in the preceding classes (CHIN 106a, 106b and CHIN 107a). Especially when not a China concentrator.
The course itself is vital to those interested in pre-modern East Asian research, regardless of field, whether it be China, Japan, Korea, etc.
I think what makes this class good or bad probably has a lot to do with who's teaching it. I had a wonderful time taking it with Chen, but next year may be different.
