This course will introduce you to a fascinating and understudied period of Chinese intellectual history. Two years (preferably more) background in Literary Chinese is necessary-- most texts do not exist in translation and you will be translating for the rest of the class.
This course assumes prior extensive background in reading documents in classical Chinese, as well as modern Chinese scholarship on Chinese history.
you must be prepared to devote a LOT of time and energy to this course
I would recommend this class to anybody interested in Ming-Qing because it is one of the few that opens up many new avenues to thinking about the period. I would like to see larger participation and think that it is the kind of course which would benefit through multiple perspectives.
The class is difficult, but helpful, especially for familiarizing oneself with legal texts.
