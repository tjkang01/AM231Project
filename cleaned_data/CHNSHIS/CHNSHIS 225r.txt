Bol is incredibly inspiring and you will learn a lot about Chinese history and think about it the way you never did. But don't even bother if you don't want to spend 10 hours every week reading classical chinese.
We learned to apply digital humanities into the study of local history and a lot about the local elite in Jinhua from the 12th to the 16th centuries.
A very inspiring and illuminating class. It is definitely not just about making you know the history but also making you thinking the history. It trains you the way of critically analyzing the materials.
