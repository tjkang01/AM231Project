Professor Elliott is AMAZING
Demanding but very rewarding course.
Take it.
If you are a Ming or Qing historian, you absolutely need to take this course. If you work on the Republic or pre-Ming China (at least Song/Yuan) or Choson Korea, you will likely find the skills taught in this course quite valuable. Though the first term is far more valuable for learning how to read late imperial administrative documents than the second term, the second term is still extremely useful as a place to put the skills you've learned into practice in your own work.
