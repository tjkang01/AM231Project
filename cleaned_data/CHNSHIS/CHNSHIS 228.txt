The course will be a rewording and mind-open adventure for those who are interesting Chinese intellectual traditions and social transformation in imperial period.
It's a great starting point to learn about Neo-Confucianism and Chinese intellectual history.
This is a wonderful, challenging, and stimulating course, and Professor Bol is an extraordinary teacher.  It should be born in mind, however, that this class is very demanding - a solid background in classical Chinese is almost a necessity.
This course will challenge your understanding of Neo-Confucian texts. It is a must for those undertaking serious study of Neo-Confucianism in any context, introducing the most salient material to the development of this intellectual culture. Be prepared to work hard, learn much, and rethink your initial perception of the topic.
It will be tough but very rewarding if you take it seriously to learn
If you are interested in early-modern Chinese history and don't take this course then you are missing out.
This class will introduce you to some of the major thinkers in the Neo-Confucian tradition in a particularly illuminating way. A necessary class for anyone who wants to know about Chinese thought and intellectual history.  Good to have a couple years of literary Chinese prior to taking this class.
You will be surprised how much information is hidden in a very short piece of ancient text, and Professor Bol will help you pull out all of it.
