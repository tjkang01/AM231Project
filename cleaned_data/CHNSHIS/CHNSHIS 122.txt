Great class with a fun professor.  Gives a great general overview of religion in China.  I would take it again.
Professor Sun is adorable, and very knowledgable in her field. I took this class thinking that it would be low time commitment for quite interesting content, and it turned out to be even less work than I'd expected. Although not much was demanded of me, I definitely feel like I learned a lot!
