Very interesting class that gives you a great introduction to drug mechanisms and design.
If you are interested in the drug discovery process, this course provides extensive coverage from many different angles.
That the course contains useful information, but that due to its being taught by so many different professors, it feels a bit disjointed.
The topics of this class are interesting, but somehow not delivered in the most effective manner. Too many faculty are involved in teaching a component of the class, but not very well connected. The final proposal is interesting though.
Too much work but lots of good information to learn.
This is a good basic course for people who are interested in drug design. Some of the lectures are very informative, however some are a little too basic and seem as though they are meant for non-scientists.   The work load is very reasonable, which is nice - especially for graduate students.
