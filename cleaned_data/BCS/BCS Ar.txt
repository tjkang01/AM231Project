This course is a wonderful introduction to BCS. The materials are very useful and accessible, and Aida is a great teacher. The atmosphere is collaborative and creative and I feel that we made the most out of the (slightly too limited) time we had.
This class is a great opportunity to learn BCS in a friendly, supportive setting. Aida is a phenomenal and dedicated instructor, and even though you only meet twice a week, you will learn a ton!
Definitely take this course if you have a general interest in learning the material.
Professor Vidan is wonderful, and the class is really fun. You'll get a lot more out of it if you're motivated to work on your own, though.
This is a really fun class and Aida is a really great professor. You'll get out of this class as much as you put in, so it's important to be self-motivated.
I don't think you can find in the world a better instructor for this subject.
