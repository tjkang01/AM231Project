BCS with Aida is engaging, friendly, fun, and moldable to your own personal and academic interests. If you are interested in the Balkans, this is the class to take to prepare yourself to explore them more deeply.
If you are at all interested in BCS or the Balkans (or film or nonfiction or poetry or journalism or Renaissance plays or South Slavic troubadours), take a class with Aida. She is amazing and so smart and you will learn a ton.
