It is a fun course, especially once you get past the point of discussing theories and start talking about actual materials of folklore.
This course brought me life during the week. It was a comfortable space, since we had a small class and met in a house with tea and cookies, and gave us plenty of opportunities to ask questions and talk. I did expect to spend more time on folktales and myths than we did, as opposed to reading and thinking about academic literature on the folklore. Overall a relaxed, loosely structured course that for the first half is about folklore scholarship and then for the second half about the music, visual art, material culture, and folktales of South Asia.
Great course - very intimate at only 4 people, but if people knew how good it was I'm sure many more would enroll. Leah is amazing and brings snacks to every class! Reading was manageable (~100p. a week) and always interesting. Discussion was always enjoyable. If Leah were staying I would highly recommend!
It's a great class! Leah is very knowledgeable and an awesome person to get to know. She is always willing to help you out--just go to her office hours!
A brilliant class to take. Very interesting and not too much work required and yet you earn a lot about South Asia.
This class is so wonderful! It's a great and light overview of all the different folklore genres in South Asia, and it DOES cover all areas of South Asia, not just India. The folklore collection project is really fun and interesting, and gives you a taste of what ethnography is like, but in an accessible way. Class itself is really chill and just a discussion of the readings- if you have any interest in South Asia at all or just want to learn more about the area's traditions and art forms, this class is optimal for that.
