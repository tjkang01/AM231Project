Excellent course that will introduce you to a very interesting body of material and raise questions of essential importance to the study of human culture in general. Take the course.
Professor Mitchell is a great teacher and the subject matter is fascinating.
Steve's classes are interesting, and fun.  Take them all!
If you have the opportunity to take this class, do so!
This was one of the most rewarding classes I've taken at Harvard- so engaging!
Amazing class. The discussion was always very engaging and unique with fun weekly presentations. All the reading was worth it, and if any of it was too denseOr confusing your fellow students were there to help you through it. So much fun!
