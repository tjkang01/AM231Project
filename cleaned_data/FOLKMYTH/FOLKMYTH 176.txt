This class is really great if you're interested specifically in tattoos and tattoo history, but would probably also be valuable if you want the experience of picking an interesting art medium and following its development through history
This is a really fun class that delves into really fascinating topics.
This class is a perfect fourth class that is both extremely intellectually engaging and well taught. The workload is very fair.
If you like discussion- and reading-based courses, as I do, you will greatly enjoy this class. The weekly workload (a considerable number of readings and a short response paper about the readings) is definitely manageable, and the two-hour discussions about the readings are very interesting. (Other than the weekly workload, the class includes a short online midterm and a final paper.)Professor Lufkin genuinely loves the subject, which lends a great deal of enthusiasm to the class. I definitely recommend this course to anyone intrigued by tattoo!
There's a lot of reading but it's all so fascinating it's worth the hours that you put in. The historical roots are great but it's even cooler to read modern 20th century pieces and be able to make connections to something familiar from what's been read
