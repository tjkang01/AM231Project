So much fun.
This class exposes you to wonderful, frustrating, and captivating ideas regarding biodiversity, pharmaceuticals, natural medicine, and how culture and politics dictate the narratives presented on each subject. The coursework itself is not burdensome- the readings are extremely interesting, and the more carefully you dive into them, the more informed your discussions will be. Ruth is a gifted professor and will challenge you in ways that are incredibly thought-provoking. Your time will be consumed with careful thought, not busy work. It is a class that you will want to sincerely pay attention to.
Ruth is a botanical goddess. The material itself is independently SO interesting & timely, but Ruth really does provide an environment in which learning can occur more naturally without the insane pressure of production & consumption.
A really innovative course in terms of material and structure, Ruth leads thoughtful discussions and completely invests in her students
This is a class that you'll tell you kids about when you're older. The material is practical, philosophical, and humanistic at a level that you can't ignore or forget.
Ruth is a genuine goddess. Literally any class you take with her will be excellent. I found this one to be especially good because it was on subject matter that is not typically discussed at Harvard, is very interdisciplinary and can be approached from many different angles. The discussions each week felt very relaxed and Ruth created a classroom atmosphere that made you comfortable with voicing any thoughts you have. The readings each week were also fascinating, and the assignments always had a creative option to them if you felt so inclined. Take this class if you can!
