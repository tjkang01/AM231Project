Very interesting introduction to theoretical issues about folk art. Definitely for those who have a strong interest in the subject material, however.
This class is essential for students who would like to carry out their own folk art studies, but would be a valuable and engaging course for any student.  It provides a deeper understanding of the concept of "folk" and the ways it has been used historically.
This is a fun class with a great professor and room to follow your interests. Just be aware that it's more about the concept of folk art than folk art itself.
A really great class and not just because Felicity Lufkin makes the topics approachable and interesting. The straight discussion format worked really well and made for a great class dynamic helping me understand and appreciate the topics more than I thought I would or could.
