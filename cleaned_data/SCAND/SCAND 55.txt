You watch a lot of great movies and the weekly workload is not busy, but the two major assignments, especially the final, end up taking a lot of time. Take it only if you're actually interested in wanting to learn more about Scandinavian cinema.
If you want to see a great film selection on scandinavian cinema, take this class. Most of the films are also well known outside of Scandinavia. Also, there are really only two assignments, so I would recommend paying close attention and doing the readings.
