This class is excellent and Professor Mitchell is fantastic and hugely knowledgeable, especially seeing as charm magic is a major interest in his own research. Pretty much, this class involves some, at times albeit tedious, Old Norse translations and then spending two hours a week talking to one of the foremost experts in the world on Viking magic!
Professor Mitchell is an absolutely wonderful professor, who exudes passion for Norse language and culture. If you want to learn an awesome ancient language, take this course!
