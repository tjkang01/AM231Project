Go for the classic poets in the earlier classes - stay for the Surrealists!
As a graduate student I loved the readings for the class, but found the range of students (in terms of interest in poetry and language)  to sometimes be a challenge for discussions.
It is very challenging but also very rewarding. Make sure you're extremely interested in poetry!
This course offers a great introduction to a large range of French poets. The lectures are interesting and the material is very rich, but they can be pretty tough. Overall, great course for those interested in poetry.
This is an amazing class that is not too rigid or strict.
