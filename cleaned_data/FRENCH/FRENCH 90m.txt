This course will expose you to a lot of wonderful French literature and the teacher is very friendly and encourages discussion. Utilize her office hours! You will be sure to learn a lot.
This class was interesting and the material was interesting, but the readings could sometimes be too long. Andreea also didn't always understand how difficult the readings were for us. The assignments apart from readings were an average workload, though it could get to be a lot with the readings.
If you are interested in reading a broad range of great, interesting French texts you should definitely check out this course. I think that the small nature of the course and the amount of reading, writing and speaking that we got to do helped improve my French more than any other French course I have taken before.
