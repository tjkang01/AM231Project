Prof. Lionnet is a marvelous professor who introduced us to a wide variety of texts and materials to help us think about the role and representations of the sea, as well as questions of gender, race, and nationality in Francophone literature.
Prof. Lionnet is absolutely brilliant! It's wonderful to have the chance to learn from her.
