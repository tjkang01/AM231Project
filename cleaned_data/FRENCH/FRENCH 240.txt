It's so fun to be able to spend time with Professor Conley - he is excited about the material and willing to share it, and he is such a warm and inviting character. However, the class was not great. There were no assignments besides the final paper, which was nice if you didn't care about engaging with the material, but it was honestly really hard to feel like part of the class because we actually did not turn in anything besides the final paper. Class was not great because all we did every week was go for two hours and listen to Professor Conley talk (which is great, don't get me wrong, but I absolutely did not learn from the material because we were not expected to contribute).
This is a class that benefits from a good amount of self-motivation. Tom's enthusiasm for the texts is contagious, but specific assignments and secondary literature recommendations are either lacking or too multitudinous to reasonably approach.
