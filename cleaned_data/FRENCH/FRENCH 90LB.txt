The only texts in this class are Balzac, so you should have a sense of whether or not you'll like spending an entire semester with him before you enroll. Personally I didn't really connect with his philosophies and dilemmas, so I got tired of reading the same style and about the same type of dilemma every week. Professor Beizer has a lot to say about Balzac, which makes her lectures interesting but sometimes means students don't have time to develop their own ideas in class discussions. That said, bi-weekly response papers are great for developing your critical reading skills and Professor Beizer's comments are very helpful and detailed. She isn't typically available over email, but easy to talk to during office hours. This class will push your French if you've never taken 90- or 100-level before. You are expected to have sufficient grammar and vocabulary in written assignments and class discussions without direct support. Grading in this class is based on quite high standards, but the readings are very short so you have more than enough time to devote to your response papers. If you like Balzac, you will enjoy this class.
Have a thorough sense of analysis when reading the books
A great class that you will love if you like fiction stories and you like French. Professor Beizer is great although if your interpretations are atypical it's not possible to convince her of a different point of view.
Enjoy the readings for the interesting and sometimes weird stories that they are!
