EXCELLENT course.  Very interesting engagement with recent literary movement in France. Prof Priam is great, very engaging and good lecturer, incorporates a good amount of discussion into class time.
The readings are excellent and allow you to see some different and often neglected aspects of French society.
The readings are excellent and the professor is fabulous.
