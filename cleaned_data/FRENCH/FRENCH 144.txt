This was one of the very best classes I have taken in my career at Harvard. Professor Greene is incredibly kind, supportive, and approachable, and she is extremely knowledgeable about the material. The discussions were always fascinating and enjoyable, and I left every class looking forward to the next one. I was really impressed by the emphasis placed on constructive feedback, both in terms of language and expression, as well as in terms of content. If you are interested in medieval French and/or humans and animals, this class is for you, but even if you aren't, I highly recommend this class. It has been a transformative experience.
