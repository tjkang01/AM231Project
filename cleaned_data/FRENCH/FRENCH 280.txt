The class is great, especially if you're someone interested in but skeptical of contemporary literature; this class opens your eyes to its richness and accomplishments.
This class was great. It definitely took a strong background in French, but I learned a lot. Professor Bouju was so wonderful - he was always willing and available to meet outside of class, and he was encouraging, helpful, and considerate. I really cannot say enough positive things about him. The class itself was hard, but it was rewarding. We read a lot, and some of the books I liked more than others, but I always appreciated the book following the class even if I didn't before.
This was definitely one of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard .the literature was so interesting, and the class style was what I dream all Harvard classes would be like- small, round table discussions with the professor and other passionate students. Definitely take notes when you are reading the books and even take notes all on a separate sheet of paper with page numbers written down of good excerpts so that during discussion you are quick to comment.
The books will be a bit daunting at first, but the discussions about them will shed a lot of light!
This is a fabulous course that explores contemporary French literature; discussion is very engaging and the ideas are interesting. You should have an interest in doing close reading texts and interpretation.
