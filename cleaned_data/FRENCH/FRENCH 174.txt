Take this course if you like analyzing literature and thinking about current-day issues around the Mediterranean. It's a heavy subject, but provides an excellent way to practice and improve your French.
The books and materials in this class are very interesting, and Professor Conley really knows her stuff. She gives good lectures, although there was little student participation even though the class is supposed to be seminar-style. The readings and assignments are extremely manageable: on average, there was about 100 pages of reading plus a 100 word reflection a week. The midterm, the final, and the final project were also very doable. We had some really enjoyable discussions in section. I would recommend this class to anyone who is at all interested in the Mediterranean, who has very strong French reading, writing, and speaking skills, and who is looking for a chill French class.
Your French reading and speaking abilities will definitely improve as a result of this class.
I sometimes felt that there was not a lot of thought put into the choice of readings or to how we would analyse/take them apart. That said, I enjoyed most of the readings. I feel like I got more from them than from going to class or section. I was hoping I would enjoy the readings even a bit more, considering it was the first time I've taken a French course that focuses on non-French non-European non-white writers. The course needs some structural improvements, I feel.
This course requires a lot of reading
