This is a terrific introduction to medieval French literature for graduates and advanced undergraduates, whether they have encountered medieval texts before or not.
An excellent class offering a truly comprehensive introduction to one of the most dynamic and interesting bodies of literature in existence.
Virginie is a gifted, passionate teacher who brings so much enthusiasm and acumen to every class section; in a topic as broad as the idea of "subjectivity" in medieval literature, her drive to zoom in on particular issues or knots at the core of texts lends this class a high degree of focus and momentum. This seminar is unique in its ability to challenge those with prior knowledge of the field at the same time as it welcomes those who are just beginning to test the waters or who are looking to fill in gaps of their knowledge of French literature. This flexibility (combined with the natural intensity of the questions and issues considered) made this class a real highlight for me.
If you think you have sufficient preparation, I would absolutely recommend this course. Even if you don't have a particular interest in the middle ages, the ideas discussed in the course are incredibly relevant to western literature as a whole. And Virginie is amazing.
I entered the class knowing very little about medieval French literature, but now I feel very knowledgeable! The class is challenging, but Prof. Greene's expectations are always clear for each assignment. You will get to read great primary and theoretical texts, often juxtaposed in fun, interesting ways!
This is a wonderful course in which the readings and writings assignments really challenge you to think about subjectivity in the middle ages. Professor Greene is very accessible and organized a very stimulating seminar.
This is a great class with a fantastic reading list and good discussions - be prepared to do a lot of reading and writing in French.
