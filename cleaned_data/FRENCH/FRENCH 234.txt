It will be difficult to follow discussions or write the final paper/prepare a presentation without having some background knowledge on this topic. But if you really wanted to do it and put in effort to check in with the professor, I'm sure she would be really helpful in making sure you followed along.
Prof. Lionnet is a really dynamic professor who cares about her students. If you have any interest in the Francophone, I highly recommend.
You are lucky to be taking a class with Professor Lionnet.
This is an absolutely engaging class that anyone who is interested in what literature can and should accomplish on the global stage should consider taking. Franoise Lionnet teaches these materials with uncommon insight and authority that shines in the classroom and always manages to expose the nuances surrounding the question of human rights in a clear and comprehensible way through literary theory and literary texts.
Despite the workload, I took this course as an elective and am so glad I did. If you are at all interested in French literature, colonization, migration in countries affected by French imperialism, or human rights issues, you NEED to take this course. In one semester, you learn so much with a top, widely recognized scholar in her field.  The selection of readings is phenomenal. The class (perhaps coincidentally) was also extremely diverse in national origins, backgrounds, specializations, and French levels. Most are in French, so your French will improve. you can choose to participate and write in French or English. Beware, however, that the readings tend to run at around 500 pages a week or higher sometimes, and you have to write a weekly response paper, so the workload is not light. There is also a long final paper, so be prepared to do that. It can be difficult to keep up with if you are writing your thesis at the same time, but Lionnet is very patient and understanding.
