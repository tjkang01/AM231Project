This is a great class and you will learn a lot from the professor. She is very passionate about the subject matter and it's easy to share in her enthusiasm. Just realize that it will be up to you to structure your foray into contemporary French philosophy, i.e. set your own writing deadlines and break up the reading in a manageable way.
If you are interested in the readings, start a discussion group.
Great if you have an interest in French post-structuralist thought or just wider questions of politics and aesthetics - really dynamic and cutting-edge readings that could enhance any field of study in the humanities.
I do not think that Prof. Conley is interested in engaging the students with these texts. She doesn't deal with the texts, does not reconstruct their argument (or ask students to do it), does not challenge them in any serious way, and does not lead a discussion except to ask if we "liked the reading" - that's not a discussion question!
