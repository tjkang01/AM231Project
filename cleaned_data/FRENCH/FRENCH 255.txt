Prof. Beizer is a great instructor. She will sometimes look at you like you are being obviously thick and not making any sense, but it will only make you stronger. While she can be a harsh grader, she appreciates punctuality with assignments and is willing to meet and chat about your progress (and will not let you BS no matter how good you might be at it). The course itself is quite difficult, but entertaining. Vampires are fun and, overall, all the works studied are interesting, but it can get a bit dry sometimes, especially toward the end of the course when Freud and his Uncanny step in to make your life hell. Nonetheless, give it a shot and most likely you will not regret it.
