It's really interesting
Thanks to a carefully-assembled syllabus, Marculescu does a good job presenting the thesis that witchcraft provides a useful means of looking at the history of French literature, as well as gender, religion, and European culture in general. She's an amiable discussion leader and capable lecturer as well, though she tends to go on tangents sometimes. Highly recommended!
A terrific, comprehensive introduction to a surprisingly large field of study. Be ready for a fair amount of reading; a high French reading level would be helpful. (Coming from a 70-level class, I did very well in the course but got a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of reading.) But, fair, doable assignments and genuinely interesting texts.
Subject and readings are interesting but class discussion can get a little slow since the topic is so narrow.
This course has the potential to be a great course if it is offered again in future years. While a lot of the course material is interesting, discussions weren't the highlight of the course. Assignments are graded fairly and the course isn't that much work until the final paper. Professor Marculescu obviously knows a lot about the subject and the course will hopefully improve as she continues to teach.
This is definitely a literature course but taught in French. If you want to improve on your oral or writing skills I would recommend taking another course.
