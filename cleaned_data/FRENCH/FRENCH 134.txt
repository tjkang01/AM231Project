This is a phenomenal class, by far one of my favorite french classes at harvard, especially because it integrates the old literature with newer literature, media, and especially discussion!
Outstanding French class.  Professor Bilis is great - a native French speaker but culturally American, the ideal combination for learning the language at a high level.
This class is no doubt one of the best French classes, and classes in general, I have taken at Harvard. Professor Bilis was so incredibly impressive. She was encouraging, accessible, so smart, and always willing to help; I feel like she sincerely cared about how all of us did and how all of us engaged with the material. The way she organized the class was also amazing - compared to other French classes I have taken, there were more things to do per week, but I never resented these things, in fact I really loved them. They helped me to engage with the material without being overwhelming. I can't say enough amazing things about this class!!
excellent experience. helene is a wonderful professor and actually cares about you improving your french abilities which is manifest in her, for instance, taking the time to correct your homework for grammar etc so you can learn from your mistakes
