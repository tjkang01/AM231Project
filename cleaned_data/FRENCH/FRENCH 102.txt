This class is very interesting and well-run.  You will learn quite a bit.  Not for those who get behind on reading or who like a huge variety in texts.
Definitely not a breeze, a good amount of reading each week, good discussions and assignments that require a good amount of thought. But also, not overwhelming, and a really, really fantastic survey course on a fascinating body of literature.
Readings are death warmed over but the historical context is interesting.
Lots of reading which requires careful attention to detail.
Make sure you like medieval French before taking the course.
it's a great class and prof. greene is amazing! but because of the small size of the course, you really have to keep on top of the reading assignments so be prepared for a fair amount of reading.
