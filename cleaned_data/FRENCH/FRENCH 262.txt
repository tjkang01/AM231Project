This class is challenging but extremely rewarding.
This was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Prof. Lionnet is very insightful, encouraging, and inspires students to produce thoughtful and interesting work.
I highly recommend Professor Lionnet. She is an expert in her field, generous and cares deeply about students' work and input.  Promotes collaboration and is passionate about her field.  I have been greatly influenced by her thought and will continue to take the courses she offers to better shape the focus of my own research.  She is very clear and able to explain complex ideas succinctly and with elegance.
Excellent professor with broad and specific knowledge of Francophone literature and theories associated with it.
One of the best classes I have taken here at Harvard, and this coming from someone who doesn't necessarily specialize in transnational literature. Prof Lionnet creates a very welcoming (yet intellectually challenging) environment where students from other diverse departments also felt comfortable contributing their thoughts and perspectives to a classroom where literature and literary theory was being discussed.
