If you want to re-evaluate your relationship to the book, take this class.
Don't get scared off by the boring-sounding name; it's the best grad class in the English dept.
Ann and Leah are the coolest!
Take this class: it will open up new doors for you in how you approach the study of literature and books in general.
This class is as rigorous as it is exciting, and, by introducing the general parameters and major texts in book history, it opens up avenues of inquiry in each student's field.
A great class. I'm sure the kinks in the syllabus will be worked out the next time it is offered.
I would tell students that they should enroll in this course even if they are not explicitly interested in book history. They will leave the course with a useful set of tools, and a broad sense of the many ways in which a project can be shaped.
This is a great opportunity to learn all the tools of the "Book History" discipline with two excellent seminar leaders and pioneers of the field. The structure of the course allows for time and freedom to dive deep into a subject and produce something useful.
It is unfortunate that this course is so unique, as the tools and methods it investigates are useful across a wide range of fields, and promote a rigorously interdisciplinary approach to history and literary criticism. You could not ask for more knowledgeable, generous, and engaged teachers than Leah and Ann. It is exciting to become part of the community of scholars they create over the semester, and their engagement makes for a wonderfully flexible, fun, and enlightening course.
Professors Price and Blair are wonderful teachers and have designed a brilliant course, but above all you'll enjoy meeting the other students in the course. It's a terrific chance to get outside your department and see how people think in other fields.
Gives you a very cool chance to work on book history and with manuscripts; very helpful in giving you another approach to use in future research.
