Definitely worth taking, especially if you have any sort of gov background. The class was very interesting from a political perspective. Not an overwhelming amount of reading. Good discussions.
You're not going to have readings like this in any other English class, and it's a chance to learn about one of the most criminally underreported and underpublished societies on Earth.
This class was a wonderful way to encounter a very different type of "literature," and it is definitely not your classic Harvard English course, which I appreciated. Philip is a great professor with an enthusiasm for the material and is very knowledgeable about aboriginal literature.
A great class if you are interested in indigenous studies and particularly Aboriginal issues in Australia.
