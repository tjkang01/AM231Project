Prof. Watson is definitely a great professor to work with. He is exceedingly helpful in giving advice and offering help. His comments are to the point, smart and very very interesting! It was the event of my week to attend this seminar. I never laughed so much as in this class.
Do not expect this to be an easy course just because you've taken a Middle English component in your undergraduate years. There is a great deal of reading to be done, most of it comprising texts one does not usually encounter. That's what makes the course rewarding, but a lot of hard work.
