Marina's really great, the readings are amazing.
I had never taken an English class, so understandably I was a bit nervous about what this would entail. All in all a wonderful class! Readings were great, assignments were actually enjoyable, class discussions were always fun, and instructor was wonderful: very helpful and just a genuinely great person. I would definitely recommend taking this class, or anything else Marina teaches!
