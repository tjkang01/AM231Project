As the name implies, this is a very non-standard English course, which makes it both confusing and exciting. It can be difficult to keep up with all the ideas and theories of vernacular being thrown around throughout the course; make sure to take the time to think about the way you're reading the vernacular and why the vernacular novels you're readings are enjoyable/interesting. Don't overanalyze (it's not linguistics), and take the time to meet with and talk to Marina. She knows a lot, and will very enthusiastically help you out with your paper theses and arguments! Earlier this semester I was having doubts about my paper-writing skills and English secondary; this is the first course where I've been excited about most of the things I've read and written!
This course would be especially important for any student planning to focus on Africa, whether in literature, history, economic development, or the arts.  The African literature and commentaries we read were particularly interesting.
Definitely try to get ahead in the readings because it can be hard when you transition to a book a week.
