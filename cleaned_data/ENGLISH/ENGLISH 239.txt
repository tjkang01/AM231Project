Leah is a wonderful professor! She has great enthusiasm for the subject matter, is extremely knowledgable, embraces all literary backgrounds, and picked very interesting material!
It's a great chance to study some European writers you will rarely get the chance to study explicitly in an English course!
This class is definitely to be taken by anyone specializing in Renaissance or even medieval literature, as it provides essential context and points of contrast for analyzing texts of the English Renaissance. It requires intensive reading and engagement, though!
