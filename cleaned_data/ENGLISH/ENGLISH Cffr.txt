Great learning experience
This class really expands on the generic creative courses that are generally offered here. If you are interested in working with source material and spearheading its adaptation process, this class is quite rewarding. Bear in mind that this is not necessarily an introductory screenwriting course. It would definitely help to have some background in the medium, but you could probably get by without it.
Mark is a great great guy who is very honest and at the same time very constructive. Don't be afraid to ask him all of the questions--he's always ready to help. He also values collaboration in the classroom a lot, and really appreciates when students have ideas for each others' works, so just don't be afraid to speak out at all. Creative writing classes are generally awesome classroom  environments, but this one really felt like a safe space for all of us to learn from each other. Seriously of all of the ones I've taken (three) this one was by far the most enjoyable.
This course is a great way to become more familiar with yourself as a writer.  It is also a great way to learn how to give and take writing criticisms.
It's cool. Apply.
