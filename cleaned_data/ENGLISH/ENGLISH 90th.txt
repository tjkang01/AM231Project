It's a great class. Do the readings!
Be prepared to work, but amazing course! Best decision in the college career so far to take this course.
Engaging, rewarding course!
This was definitely one of my favorite courses at Harvard. Professor Carpio is amazing, and the material is so interesting. Take it!!
If you like Jazz Age/Harlem Renaissance literature, definitely take this class! It's a really interesting way to look at the Jazz Age interracially and see the two "ages" as inseparable from each other in a way that isn't often done. A new perspective on both time periods as not independent from each other that makes reading this great literature even more interesting. Especially good for people who like reading literature in a very historical/social context.
This is the best class I have taken at Harvard.  Professor Carpio is so nice and really breaks down the readings for you.  I learned to view the readings and the themes of the class in a completely different way, and it was great to be in a small class setting.
Really interesting class, gives you an opportunity to explore the world of 1920s black literature through a new lens
