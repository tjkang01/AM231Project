This was a great seminar that I found by chance and ended up really enjoying. It focuses an unusual and exciting list of novels.
This course really helped me adjust to the standard of 90 level seminars.  This class would be far easier if one had already read Foucault etc. but it's not necessary. The workload isn't that large, although some of the novels are plain weird. They got easier to comprehend. I liked Dr Babcock's respectful, if slightly tentative sometimes, teaching style. He facilitates discussion well and really let's ideas come through.
If you are into the topic, you will really enjoy the course. The title sounds strange, but the course is just about how people experience disease and attacks on the body. It has colonial undertones, but is mostly about  the affects of disease and the exploitation of the human body. We do one book every two weeks so the reading load is totally manageable. I really enjoyed the discussions and reading the texts. A great English seminar.
The class was fine, but there weren't very many opportunities to be graded (two papers and a presentation). We also had to keep every single reading of each novel tightly wound around the "theme" of the course. There was really no opportunity to make any interpretation that wasn't based on post-colonialism.
Professor Babcock was great in his first semester here - enthusiastic about the material and discussions - and will definitely get even better with time.  The reading list is pretty good, if you enjoy modern novels generally in the realm of science fiction.  If this class remains "Postcolonial Epidemics," then be aware that the title is not quite accurate.  The novels are mostly about epidemics, and the class spends much of its time trying to tie those narratives together with colonialism.
