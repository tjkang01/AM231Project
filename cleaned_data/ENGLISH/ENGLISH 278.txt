Take a class with Menand. He's a boss.
Take this as an opportunity to expand your familiarity with twentieth century canon.
This course is invaluable for anyone studying post-war American literature and culture.
I would recommend this course to anyone with an interest in the intellectual and cultural life of post-war America, whether they study English or not. Prof Menand is as good a seminar leader as I've seen at Harvard.
Take it. Prof. Menand is a great teacher. Not everyone will agree with his style, but it is a unique style, and memorable. Readings are fantastic and push you to think in new ways.
Glenda carpio is a GREAT teacher with lots of enthusiasm and passion for the subject matter. You will feel completely engaged by her. And learn a lot.
