The material to be read is wonderful. Prof. Whittington is great at taking the material and helping you to put it in context and the input of the other students will make this class spectacular.
Professor Whittington is a tough grader, but her lectures are so brilliant that it's worth it. This class will really help you understand classical literature and how traditions stemming from Ovid extend through Renaissance literature.
One of the best seminars, and one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. The reading list is amazing, and Professor Whittington's enthusiasm for the texts is infectious. I highly recommend this course whether you are an English concentrator or a non-concentrator just looking for a fun English elective.
