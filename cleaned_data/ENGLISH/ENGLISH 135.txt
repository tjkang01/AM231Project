Very enjoyable class with a great reading list, fair and balanced workload, and really unparalleled opportunity for discussing exactly what interests you about the works you read because of the small class setting. Kate also provided some of the most personalized, detailed feedback I've received on my writing since coming to college. With the opportunity for essay revision and her willingness to help with every step of the process, I feel like my writing and reading skills have both greatly improved over the course of the semester.
The attention the professor gives in this class is worth taking alone as you can tell she holds great enthusiasm for the course's topic.
