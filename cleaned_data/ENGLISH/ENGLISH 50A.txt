Eighteenth century is strange. It comes after great works and before the romantics. So I didn't think I would enjoy the course, but Prof Osadetz' enthusiasm was infectious. And it forced me to engage critically with ideas that are timeless and ideas more particular to the time period. The course and section were taught well, so I definitely recommend this course if you're looking for a non intimidating way to engage with poetry. Also the reading groups were fun. Made friends during poetry readings.
This class was backloaded with too many assignments. Only take this class if you really want to know more about 18th century poetry. Prof. Osadetz is wonderful but the class really had too much work.
This class is a ton of fun! There is a huge focus on enjoying poetry -- you do reading groups in bars and cafes! You should definitely take it. The TF Matt taught me more about poetry than the two poetry classes I took before this class combined.
Good class, great discussions and poetry, work assigned rather haphazardly and with kind of unrealistic expectations.
Take it, but only if someone other than Prof. Osadetz is teaching it.
Be ready to think until it hurts!
Contrary to most expectations, eighteenth century poetry is a blast to read, by turns moralistic, vulgar, satirical, and romantic.  Material in lecture could be better organized and tends not to draw on information or analysis from outside the introductions in the textbooks.  The workload was not particularly voluminous but assignments were harshly graded, albeit with assiduously composed comments written by the T.F.  Section discussions were rigorous and analytical.
Be prepared for a lot of reading and a high number of assignments.
This is a fantastic course for potential English concentrators. The professor and TF are passionate about the material, and the workload is not especially overwhelming.
