amazing class! Stauffer is my favorite professor! He facilitates discussions very well and the reading list is excellent. All really great books to read in a seminar context
Professor Stauffer is kind, but the course is unstructured and often too student-driven. Still, it's a great reading list, probably the most all-encompassing look at American modernism offered in the department.
This is a great reading list but I found in-class discussion less than stimulating, in part due to the makeup of the class but in part due to the purely discussion-based format.
This class will give you a well-rounded and in-depth overview of American modernism. Professor Stauffer is awesome (if a little absent-minded at times) and is a complete expert on this stuff. He is really good at facilitating discussion and encouraging everyone to speak. The books are great, but there's definitely a lot of reading. Make sure you have time to do the reading before you sign up for this class.
It's a very chill class with enough assignments to not make it a joke. Overall a solid seminar.
Really good class that will get better in its second iteration. Stauffer is amazing - a genius, kind, supportive, and helpful. Would be great if it had been capped at 12 to have the real pressure of a small English seminar.
