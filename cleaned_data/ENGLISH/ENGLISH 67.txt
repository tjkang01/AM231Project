Professor Stauffer is an amazing professor.  He is engaging, really cares about his students (readily meets with them, reads all the final papers, etc.).  Take one class with him before graduating!
Approaching the class independently is the best way to get the most of out it -- i.e. do all the readings, engage with the teachers, think about the pithy commentaries, apply what you learn to other experiences in the semester, go to all office hours.  Group moments are lackluster.
Be wary if you are taking a lot of reading- and writing-heavy classes. While it is doable to get through this course while doing a lot of reading for other courses, I think you would get more out of it if this is the class that you can focus all or most of your humanities energy on.
I really enjoyed this class. The text selections are fantastic and you learn a lot by reading American literature through a capitalistic lens, if such a subject interests you. Professor Stauffer's contextualization of the texts is useful and fascinating (he has a strong sense of American social history). You also learn a lot about improving your writing on short "pithy commentary" assignments (Marissa Grunes' feedback is always useful and comprehensive). Grading can be a bit tough and the class, like most common ground courses, revolves around good student participation.
This course is amazing. Yes, there are a lot of readings (a book per week), but Stauffer is an interesting lecturer and really makes sure he engages students in discussion.
