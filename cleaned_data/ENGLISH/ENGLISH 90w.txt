Solid introduction to Wordsworth, Engell deeply learned but nevertheless intellectually flexible, the ideal guide for such an intro
There is a lot of one on one time with the professor and professor Engell is a great professor to work with and get to know. I think that everyone will get something different and great out of working with professor Engell.
Be prepared for a public speaking component to this course.  But also, the professor cares a great deal about his students' work, the assigned materials were challenging but not too fast-paced, and the methodology employed in the course (close-reading, with supplemental biographical information) is excellent.
