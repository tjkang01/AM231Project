This is an interesting exploration of a language whose study is somewhat simplified by its obvious connection with modern English, yet strange, removed, and interesting as well. It is first a language course and only then a literature course.
Take this class if taught by Joey McMullen, he is a saint and a great professor.
It is tough, yet interesting
A want to learn a dead language is needed in order to appreciate the language and how it is formed and developed over time. Also a want to know more about old english texts.
It satisfies requirements and can sometimes generate enthusiasm.
I only took this course because it fulfilled the Foreign Literature Requirement that the English and History & Literature Departments impose on their students, and I frankly dreaded taking it. I was very pleasantly surprised, however. The course is engaging and occasionally even fun, and the texts are terrific. It is not exceptionally difficult, but it is not a joke by any means, and the weekly workload (translations, studying for the frequent quizzes, etc.) is actually quite heavy.
