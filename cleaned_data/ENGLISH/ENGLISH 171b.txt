This class is awesome.  Develops a narrative of American history and literature through specific classics and genres.  Profs. Carpio and Sollors are really knowledgeable and great teachers too.
This class, if you're willing to put the time in, is extremely rewarding. You garner better insight into what American literature is, and how it has grown over since its origins. Sollors and Carpio are also just plain awesome.
