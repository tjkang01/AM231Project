Do not be intimidated by Gordon Teskey. He is an approachable instructor who teaches his students not only about Milton but how to read Renaissance works with an appreciative and critical eye.
Definitely take this class if you love Milton. It was phenomenal. The discussions are very fun and interesting, and the "lecture" portions of the discussion by Prof. Teskey always took an interesting angle at the day's subject. It's a really great way to read a lot of Milton that you might not encounter in another class and to get a fuller understanding of the poet's work.
This course was diverse, fascinating, and fast-paced. I would definitely recommend it to anyone interested in writing about Milton in the future, but I would recommend that they actively pursue their particular interests outside of class, and try to be proactive about communicating with Professor Teskey about their own goals for the course.
If you want to study the best poet in English (next to Shakespeare), and really engage with his poems in an "up-close and personal" style, guided by a master professor who is also a central authority on this subject, while learning a great deal from Milton's biography in the process, I enthusiastically recommend this course to you. This is a can't-miss class for any student of English.
This class would be better as a lecture.
