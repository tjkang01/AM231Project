Great class for hist & lit students looking to fulfill the multicultural lit requirement or anyone who is interested in literature that deals with race & freedom in the US. It was a great exercise in close-reading texts and discussing them in an intimate setting. Marina is very knowledgeable and approachable; though the writing assignments are rigorous, there are many opportunities to seek feedback on drafts which will improve your writing (and grade) overall. Be prepared to do a significant amount of reading.
Prof. Bilbija lucidly discusses and. Working with her you'll learn how to express yourself clearly and concisely both in essays and in discussion; you'll also be exposed to a whole slew of scholarly debates about the texts that were relevant pre-Civil War and are still relevant now. The class definitely leans literary, with not so many legal texts, and the readings can often be difficult to get through simply because they're sort of old literary works. All in all, though, this course thoroughly covers a lot of literature that's overlooked or underappreciated. Would recommend!
I do not think courses like this are offered enough at Harvard. This kind of thinking--about constructions of race in US society--should be required of all students.
