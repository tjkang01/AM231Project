If you have the opportunity, take this rich, deep, challenging, exciting class.
The course is quite a bit of work and you can't do everything. But do make time for the primary readings (I know when there's a lot of writing, this is the first thing to go for many).
Any chance to cover these poets with Stephen Burt is worth taking. I would warn them that there is a lot of reading and writing (but I would also advise them: this is not a bad thing). I might tell them that it helps to have read and written on some of this poetry and criticism beforehand, but I'd also add that it's not a prerequisite.
You will work hard, you will think deeply, you will write a lot, and when it's all over, you will be very grateful that you took it.
This is an outstanding class. It's a lot of work, but really rewarding it if you want to learn more about poetry or are already invested in it.
This course is a unique opportunity to engage with a variety of poetry in an intriguing and complex manner. It offers a chance for both close reading and theoretical contextualization.
