Professor Teskey is just fantastic, and I highly recommend this course.  The material is challenging, but grappling with poems and then having the chance to discuss them with him and with fellow students made for an incredibly rewarding semester.  The diversity of the "metaphysical poets" themselves keeps things interesting and makes the nature of each week's discussion unique.  The imitation exercises were a lot of fun and further gave me a new appreciation for the work the poet does.  And again, I can't stress how great Professor Teskey is!  This was my last course as an English concentrator, and I'm happy to say that it made for a fantastic ending to my time with the Department.
Gordon Teskey is an absolute delight. Metaphysical poetry may be new, but once you read Donne, you'll be on board.
