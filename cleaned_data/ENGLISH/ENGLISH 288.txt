I would tell them that this class is just about the best thing you could do for your poetry-reading, that it would introduce you to new poems and poets to love and grant you a newer understanding of poems and poets you already love, and it will allow you to spend time with one of the most assiduous and inspiring teachers at Harvard.
Be prepared for EXTRA assignments. When I first registered for the course, neither the online description nor the syllabus said there would be a final 25-pp. paper. Midway through the semester, when it was already too late to drop out, Prof. Vendler told us that there would be such a paper! I understand that this is only a slip, but it matters when you register for your courses based on workload and what you think you can handle. I did not appreciate having to do an additional 25 pages of research and writing when I was already swamped with work in my other classes at the department! So, beware.
Prof Vendler is an extraordinary close reader, both of poetry and of her students' essays
This was one of the most important classes I have taken here (and probably will take here).
