It's an opportunity to take a class with Elaine Scarry, which is reason enough--even better, though, it's a deep, diverse investigation of a single author who may or may not be taught elsewhere at Harvard, and it includes an enormous range of secondary readings, one you definitely won't find collected in one classroom anywhere else in the world.
One of the best seminars I have ever taken.  I walked in never having read a Thomas Hardy novel, and I walked away feeling (and still feel) that I want to pursue Thomas Hardy studies as part of my graduate work.  I also walked away with a new favorite author.
If you enjoy reading novels and are ready to read a long one almost every week, this is the course for you. The theoretical material is challenging, but extremely well-balanced, and the coursepacks are tailored to the requirements of the course, so I, at least, never felt bogged down by vast amounts of reading. Writing and discussing short papers is one of the most enjoyable and rewarding aspects of the course, so do take them seriously!
Anyone interested in Hardy, the novel, the ways in which literature, science, and philosophy can illuminate one another, or simply in becoming a better and more sensitive reader, should sign up for this course at their earliest opportunity.
Take this course and prepare yourself for an awesome experience if you take an interest in Hardy. If you intensely don't like reading Hardy, then reconsider. This is definitely a Hardy-centric course (the philosophy is definitely secondary to the literature).
