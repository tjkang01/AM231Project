Take this course if you're interested in close reading, thinking about prosody, poetic techniques, and getting to know the value and use of poetry to an exceptionally interesting, humane, and self-critical poet. The class won't offer grand narratives about what "modernism" "is," although it will track WCW's influences from the Romantic and Victorian period, and influences on later poets. WCW can, like any writer substantially committed to poetry as part of the tissue of his or her life, revitalize notions of what poetry can do and why it's worth doing, and can also teach you a great deal about life in the process. If you're not convinced, then take the class for the sake of studying with Prof Burt, who can make obscure poems transparent as if by magic, and may be the most energetic, dedicated, and thoughtful mentor you'll encounter. You needn't be focused on poetry to learn from him about literature, the academic profession, pedagogy, and whatever else you consider important.
very enthusiastic and supportive professor
