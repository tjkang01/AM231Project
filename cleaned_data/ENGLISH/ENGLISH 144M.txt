A course on 18th century literature may not sound all that sexy to somebody who doesn't know much about that time period. I certainly shopped the class with reservations, and recognized fairly few authors on the syllabus. But this class is incredible. If you want to widen your perspective of the world and what fiction does to you, and if you want to be in a class where you always feel the hour ends too soon amidst the amazing discussions, then take this class. If you are at all unsure about taking this class, talk to Professor Osadetz, because he will convince you how awesome it is.
The class is fantastic if you need a reminder of why older literature still merits close study. This isn't a class concerned primarily with readings from dead, white men (title aside). Rather, it tries to explore the moral foundations of modern literature. If that sounds even remotely interesting, then you should take this class.
