It has a fair amount of reading but the reading is well spread out and very well explained in class.
Professor Whittington is an amazing teacher. She is the rare Harvard professor who actually takes an interest in her students' intellectual development, and helps them grow beyond the requirements of the classroom. I feel very lucky to have studied with her.
This was a very engaging class with a very dedicated professor. I enjoyed all of the readings and the meaningful discussions that came out of the weekly seminars.

This course is definitely interesting and worth while. It has a manageable amount of work and is rarely stressful. Class time can be a little slow moving during the weeks with more dense reading material
