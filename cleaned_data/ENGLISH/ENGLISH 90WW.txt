This is an amazing course taught by an amazing professor that covers a diverse array of intriguing topics. Weekly discussions are engaging, surprising, fun, and always something to which one can look forward. Take it if you can!
take this class! Professor Coriale is amazing and does a fantastic job setting up historical context, then letting the discussion go in different directions. It's also a really great syllabus of reading material, so homework never really feels like homework.
One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Prof. Coriale is engaging, fun, and blows you away with her knowledge of 19th century literature and feminist theory. The seminars are discussion-based, and Prof. Coriale does a fantastic job of keeping conversation relevant but also allowing us to talk about what we are most interested in or care the most about.
Professor Coriale is brilliant, and will change the way you think about literature, and about the category of "women's writing." This course is rare among English classes here for how seamlessly and consistently it incorporates relevant historical context as well as theory. It will make you a better reader, but also a generally more aware human being. Also, the books are great. Read all of the books!
This is a great class. The conversations are great and the books are awesome.
