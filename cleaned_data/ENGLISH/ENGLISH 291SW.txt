Take this class.  It is the single most important thing you can do for your intellectual and professional development at this stage in your career.
This is a professionalization course which will legitimately advance your ability to compete in the profession and communicate in your field. The work is demanding, and not every week's revision will be a success, but the overall results are well worth it.
In a field where "publish or perish" is the business model, I think it's savvy to take a course like this as early as possible; the insights it provides are helpful not just for the particular paper being revised, but for all subsequent writing.
This course is like a combined pro-seminar and writing workshop, and it functions really well as an introduction to the state of the field of scholarship in English in addition to its core success in providing an enormous amount of actual training in academic writing in a very short space of time. In short, it's great, and every graduate student in English should rush to take this class any time it's offered.
