Great teacher. If the class is not too big, take it.
If you are interested in the theater beyond simply reading plays or scripts, this is a good course to get you thinking about staging and acting, as well.  How did not only the content of plays but also the production of plays change in the last two centuries?  This course shows how, using the advent of Realism as its touchstone.
It was a lot of reading, and a lot of work, even if we didn't have that many written assignments. Each class focused on a different thing. I'm not sure what I took out of the course as a final thought or idea, but every discussion was interesting and engaging. Do the work and the readings, because they make the conversation interesting.
