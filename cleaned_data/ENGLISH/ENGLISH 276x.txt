There is not much discussion in class, or room for conflicting ideas.
The African American Literary Tradition is crucial to understanding both the humanistic and social scientific aspects of African American life in the U.S. The course is a must.
Occasionally unfocussed but always excellent, high-level discussion
Excellent syllabus. Interesting, thought-provoking, and oftentimes hilarious discussions. Take this class.
If you want to learn from the person who made the field what it is today, take it! You will be pleased.
There's something so invaluable about taking a class with the approach of investigating the "greatest hits" of an entire literary tradition. I was worried about all that would necessarily be left out for the sake of time, but I was pleasantly surprised by how much we were still able to cover and what kind of insight I gained by reading a selective list that nevertheless covers a huge date range.
Do not miss the opportunity to take a class with Professor Gates, especially with this reading list! It is worth it.
