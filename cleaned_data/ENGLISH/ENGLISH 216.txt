Take this course if you are interested in a course without a heavy workload, little writing during the semester, which leaves plenty of time to read and mull. Take this course if you are looking for a more guided seminar rather than one with a more freely flowing discussion.
This course requires a certain amount of independent reading and resolve! The 'minor' authors listed, and on whom some writing is required, are not discussed except very briefly in seminars, so it's up to the student to link the conceptual and analytic threads spun through the seminars to these works from the same period but lesser-known authors.
