If this or a similar class with Professor Stauffer is ever offered again--take it! And don't think twice!
This class was EXCELLENT! It was such an exciting and unique opportunity to be able to curate and exhibit to be displayed in Houghton. Professor Stauffer provided invaluable guidance throughout the process while allowing us to take agency over our cases. One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.
