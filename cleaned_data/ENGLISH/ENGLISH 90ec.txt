Prof. Scanlan lets you write about what interests you, which is awesome. A great class if you love comedy and are interested in writing for the stage or screen.
If you're reading this, then you're probably considering whether to take this course or not. Which means that it is being offered again, and this is a supremely good thing. The pace of the curriculum makes you feel like you're in a history course while engaging with some of the greatest dramatic works of an era. Prof. Scanlan is brilliant, personable, and one of the most interesting faculty members I have met at Harvard.
