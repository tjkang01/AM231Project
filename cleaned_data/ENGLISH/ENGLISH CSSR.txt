All Poirier classes are the bomb. Relaxed, seminar-style discussion of film and fiction, low-stress way to learn about and practice storytelling. Could use maybe a little more structure, but overall a fantastic class.
This class did teach me quite a bit about how stories function. I think we could have jumped into writing our screenplays (and potentially writing multiple short screenplays) earlier on in the course. But overall this was an enjoyable experience.
