This course might seem to be on an offbeat topic. But the historical and theoretical questions it addresses are extremely relevant to the study of medieval through renaissance to twentieth-century literature. The development of knowledge-systems, the semiotics of literature and film, issues of literary affect (wonder, belief etc) are just some of the things this course makes one think about.
This class is an incredible--and incredibly fun--exploration at a subject deeply relevant to literary, historical, and cultural studies.  You will be very glad that you took it!
