Read some Kipling beforehand and see what you think before you take the class.
Professor Kaiser really seems to enjoy teaching the class and makes it a great atmosphere for discussion that is enjoyable for everyone.  He gave good feedback on the papers as well.  I also enjoyed looking at one author in depth and understanding his writing as opposed to a class with a topic basis and several different authors.  It was a different approach that I felt worked well.
Great if you're interested in Kipling
This class is fantastic. The workload is moderate (the books are all fun to read), discussion is interesting, and Professor Kaiser is a wonderful teacher.
Not a lot of work, but the writing is pretty boring.
If you've never read much Kipling, this is the class for you. Completely changed my opinion of him, and for the better. Great course.
