It's very fun, and a great way to get experience with manuscripts.
As a basic introduction to Latin paleography, this course has a lot to offer. You will interact directly with MSS and learn the history of script from A to Z. A good deal of independent effort is required of students, however, to learn to actually read the scripts.
For me, it was useful both for filling a requirement for my secondary field in medieval studies and for giving me a survey of Latin manuscripts in the Middle Ages.  I think it would also be good for covering an introduction to the field of manuscript study in general, and for theory of paleography.  It is not particularly rigorous in giving strong practical training in transcription, but will give an introduction to those scripts you are likely to encounter at which times and locations.
Great class, hard work, but you will learn paleography.
