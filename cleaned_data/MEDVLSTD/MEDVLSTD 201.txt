Absolutely necessary if you are pursuing Medieval Studies.
Extremely useful for its rich research bibliography and week-to-week commentary. The intro to paleography was quick, but intensive and useful. Prepare to put more work into the manuscript project than you anticipate, but it's still not bad.
Excellent preparation for medievalists, not to miss.
This is an extremely useful class with a light to moderate work load. Don't miss it!
Prof. McCormick is very inspiring and encouraging. This course has provided medievalists with essential skills. My concentration is more on medieval literature, but I always had so much to take away from each session.
If you're a graduate student studying some aspect of medieval Europe, you simply need to take this class.  Many intro-to-discipline courses like this are fairly vague and insubstantial; not this one.  This is a fundamental step in becoming a better scholar.
Any aspiring medievalist should absolutely take this class.
Work very hard on this class, especially the paleography assignments.  I was not aware that these were graded, and they contribute to the final grade.
If you are planning on studying the Middle Ages in any measure (history, literature, science, art) you must take this course.  You will learn HOW to do research well, thoroughly and efficiently, and there is no other setting in which you can learn these skills so fully.
