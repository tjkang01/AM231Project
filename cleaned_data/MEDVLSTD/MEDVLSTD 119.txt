great class, and you learn a lot. just be ready to read and think - A LOT
A fascinating introduction to legal history, with a good measure of general history and political theory thrown in.
Such an interesting topic that will change how you think about the law, history, and religion since 400AD or so. Donahue is very effective in his argument that developments from Roman lawyers and early medieval jurists have really lasted and impacted jurisprudence for the years following. Takes a fascinating approach of following the law of wild animals, marriage, and witnesses. Don't worry if you don't understand what they are getting at in the beginning--it takes time to grasp it. Do at least some of the background readings--though they are 'optional' they really help put the pieces together.
This course is extremely informative.  You will work hard, and you may feel lost at times, but in the end you will be amazed at how well you know a topic you likely have no concept of beforehand.  Focus on the early documents, and be sure to ask clarifying questions when you need to, and the course will be very satisfying.  It was truly a pleasure to understand the causes and effects of jurisprudence and legislation through the ages.
Whether you're interested in law, history, or critical thinking, this is a great class. I walked away from every lecture with a question that kept me engaged for hours. I cannot recommend it enough,
This class is great! Quite interesting and well taught.
This is a wonderful class if the material is of interest to you. There is a lot of information and it is a very traditionally taught course, but Prof Donahue makes every effort to make the class as accessible as possible.
