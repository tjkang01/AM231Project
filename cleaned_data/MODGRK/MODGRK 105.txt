Great course with a great professor in Dr. Rapti! Short response papers, two longer papers, and lots of good discussion on films. Very low stress but you learn a whole lot on Greece through cinema.
This is a fantastic class! The films are funny, tragic, informative, and challenging.  I came in with no knowledge of Greek cinema and left with a much more critical eye toward film in general.  I would highly recommend this class to anyone interested in film, film history, Greek history and current events.
This was a great class! It is very enjoyable and has a very minimal workload. Definitely take if it is offered again!
This class is a lot of fun. It exposes you to films, filmmakers, and aspects of Greek culture that, for many people like me, would have no exposure to otherwise. There are some very fun and interesting films, some "weird" ones that are very intriguing, and other more traditional and classic. Dr. Rapti is the best, she is so sweet, patient, and is so enthusiastic about this topic that it gets everybody engaged and invested. Discussions are very laid-back and comfortable and is truly just a conversation and personal thoughts on what we've watched. I was able to enjoy this class with low stress and watched a lot of great movies! However, realize that there will also be weekly film screenings.
Take this class! Dr. Rapti is awesome!
