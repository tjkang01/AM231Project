This is a solid intro to Modern Greek course. The assignments are doable and graded fairly, as are the exams. The textbook might be a little frustrating at first because it's all in Greek, but it's a good immersion practice. The teaching staff is excellent, and you will learn to express yourself fairly well in Greek.
This class is really unique and interesting. If you have the time to dedicate to committing the vocabulary to memory, then the course will be a breeze and the classes will be fun and engaging. If you do not have that time, you will find the class doable, but it will not be as easy for you.
This class is really fun. If you have any interest in Greece or modern Greek in general, definitely take it!
