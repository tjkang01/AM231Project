The course is great, especially because it is focused on core works which are representative of the many movements in Greece, especially those after the Greek Revolution.  The in-class discussion is great, and the material selected can interest different audiences.  Professor Roilos is also always willing to help with any questions!
This is a great class that allows for close study of modern and some ancient Greek novels and poetry.
