Especially for non Greek students, this course will offer them the opportunity to engage with very interesting material that they won;t have the opportunity to appriach in any other way
This class provides an opportunity to pursue your own interests, so it makes sense to have some idea of what you would like out of the class.  If you approach it in this way, it is a good, discussion based approach.
Probably the most fascinating and learned course I have taken so far.
The course introduces several aspects of dreams--- psychoanalytic; personal; the prophetic aspect; anthropological and literary. It's very interesting for those who are interested in learning more about dreams and literature around it.
