Professor Roilos has a genuine enthusiasm for the literature studied and a true care for his students. He provided freedom to follow our own individual interests, yet carefully guided us so we would not stray off course. He encouraged discussion and was open-minded to unique points of view from his students. Learning through his guidance was truly a wonderful experience!
