This class is a lot of work, but you get MUCH better at reading Greek. I gave it a "4" for workload, but this better describes the END of the semester than the beginning (naturally, the workload increases as reading ability improves; I would have given the beginning of the semester a "3").Anyway, it's a lot of work, but you won't regret it. You will read some REALLY interesting Greek. Xenophon is the ancient world's most versatile writer, and I've learned about his work from more angles than I could never have thought imaginable the reading materials given to complement each assignment are amazing. Don't skimp on anything, though; if you're not prepared each day, it will be clear from your in-class translations. Professor Kosmin is incredible!
An amazing journey with Xenophon--but be warned, this is not exactly for the faint of heart; it will push you.
Whoever said Xenophon is boring never had Kosmin teach it. This is one of the best classes I have taken yet. Professor Kosmin is a brilliant professor and your Greek prowess will be greatly improved. If this is your first 100-level, expect to put many hours in, but it is extremely rewarding.
