I think this is a great class to familiarize oneself with ancient Greek oratory, as well as improve one's ancient Greek.
That it's awesome and they should definitely take it.
Really fun class! The dilemmas explored by the orators are reminiscent of Jerry Springer in the best possible way!
The course was great, and you should not hesitate to take it.
This course was very interesting and laid back. If you genuinely enjoy reading Greek and are comfortable sight-reading, I would absolutely recommend it. Professor Barnes is so friendly and approachable, and it was great getting to have him as a professor in such a small class.
a must-take...barnes is amazing!
This class provides an excellent opportunity to explore the rhetoric and legal implications of both famous and less well known speeches.
You'll get a lot out of this course - it contains some of the best prose ever written (Demosthenes in particular is one of the absolute greats). Just make sure you know your Greek!
This is a solid course. There is a decent amount of reading and you will learn quite a bit about Classical Athens. With that being said, there are more exciting Greek 100-level options.
If you like Ancient Greek, this is an excellent class to take.  I've come to love it more and more as the end of the semester nears.
This is a good course for anyone interested in studying Greek prose, Greek law, or late 5th/early-mid 4th century Greek. Discussions can sometimes drag, however, and not much in-class translation occurred, although opportunities to ask questions were readily available. The course might have been more engaging in the hands of a different instructor.
