This course depends more of less entirely on the professor and on your classmates, so decide accordingly! I had a great time with Prof. Henrichs.
This course made my Greek many levels better, and gave me skill at reading and understanding some of the most important texts of Western culture.
One piece of advice, for studying for general exams, would be to read as much of possible of the reading list sections of an author (beyond what is assigned on the syllabus for the class) at the time you are reading that author in 112b.
You should definitely take this class if you're a serious Classics concentrator. If you're not good at Greek, however, think about taking another class.
This class is difficult, but worth it!
David Elmer is as good as it gets.  Rob Cioffi is a TF for the ages.
While the workload is pretty high (and in fact rather difficult at times), in the end you learn a great deal in the class, and your knowledge of Greek expands considerably. Though tough while you are taking the class, at the end you are happy that you did.
It will be mandatory soon, and even in the hypothetical situation in which people were still taking generals, it is absolutely necessary for generals prep.  I would absolutely NOT recommend it for non-Classics-concentrators.
Do not take this as your first 100-level Greek class. Do not take this as your second 100-level Greek class. Take this as your *last* 100-level Greek class. Otherwise the workload will break you and you will never love Greek again.
