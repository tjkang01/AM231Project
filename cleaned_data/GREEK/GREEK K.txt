Best class at Harvard; fun, creative. Henrichs is one of a kind. Take it--if you are worthy of the course. Because it is hard, hard, hard, and you will cry, cry, cry.
It is simply one of the best things you can do to improve your Greek.
Greek composition is meant to be an enjoyable and instructive task, and Professor Henrichs does a wonderful job of making it both.
Great course, take Greek H first unless you've already done a good amount of Prose Composition in the style of Lysias.
Make sure your Greek is strong and that you have read some of the orators.
Take only if you are serious about philology, but if you are then you will take a lot away from it
The assignments will seem overwhelming at first, but don't be discouraged  you'll get much more comfortable and begin to enjoy them.  Professor Nagy's feedback is helpful and tactful.  The course is a wonderful way to learn to appreciate the colorful and imaginative writing of (at least some!) Greek authors.
Greek composition is hard but it makes you feel very proud after you've finished your compositions to think that you know greek decently well...
The course itself was excellent and very useful in enhancing understand both of Greek grammar and style of particular authors; I would warn students that this class does require a lot of preparation time (but that is to be expected for a course of this level).
