Very solid introductory course to statistical mechanics.
The class is very tough, but you learn a lot.
I would recommend how useful it is for chemistry students both in biochemistry and physical chemistry.
This course will be especially beneficial if you are interested in biological applications.  If you do not have any background in biology, you may find some things confusing, and if you are more interested in classical stat mech theory and less interested in biological problems, then this is probably not the course for you.
