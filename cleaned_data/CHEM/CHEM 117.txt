Only take this course if you feel that it will be useful to you for your own research.
Be prepared to work a lot but also to learn a lot!
You'll learn how to trouble shoot NMR, which is very useful if you are planning to do organic chemistry research
Pretty big time commitment, but definitely useful if you're planning on doing lots of organic lab work.
