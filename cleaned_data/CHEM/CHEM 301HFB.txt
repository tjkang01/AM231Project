Since this is a required course I wouldn't necessary recommend it, but it's definitely not the worst class that I've ever taken.
I'm glad the department cares about having good grad student TFs.
Do it because you have to!
Overall, a really useful and helpful course that prepares you for becoming a TF at Harvard. Also, a great way to get to know the other first years, as this is the only course that all of you take together. Lastly, a nice way to get to know the awesome teaching staff here!
Your teaching style will be improved, and you find yourself supported by a great staff!
