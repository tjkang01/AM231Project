Won't be the light course load that you would expect; requires a good deal of work every week
The students who take this class are mostly international Korean students. You really should be confident in your Korean language skill to take this class.
This course challenges all of its students to speak a lot during class discussions. Everyone has varying levels of Korean-language ability, but, as long as you try to speak and listen to others every week, you will learn a lot.
I feel like I was misled into believing that I could take this course.  Apparently, they have not had any non-heritage learners in the class in years, and thus have built a syllabus around students of Korean descent who are taking this class for...well, I'm not really sure why they are taking it.  Though the professor seemed willing to accomodate me, I found that it pretty much impossible to keep up and aside from being graded on an easier scale and meeting with the professor once a week, not much was done to make the material more accessible to me.  Non-heritage students who have finished 140 will find themselves in a dilemma - you can't go back to 140, but as it is now, 150 is just not a class for you.  It is sad that Korean language learning at Harvard poses more obstacles to those non-heritage learners who actually wish to learn the language than it does for Korean students looking to ease their credit load.
Very interactive and interesting. Fun way to learn contemporary issues in Korea.
