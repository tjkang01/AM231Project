I would recommend native speakers to take this course if they have a genuine interest in improving their Korean, especially in terms of their vocabulary/writing. However, I would caution students against taking the course for an "easy A" -- while I'm relatively certain that most students will get a high grade for the course, I'm also 100% certain that it will not be "easy" or pain-free by any means.
This class was harder than I had anticipated, but I learned so much and I'm really glad I took it. Kim Mihyun is the best! :)
If your reading/writing skills aren't very good, be ready to commit some time to your hw.
You get what you put into it.
Korean 140B really strengthens your speaking and arguing skills in Korean, while also incorporating interesting readings.
It will be good practice for speaking, reading and discussing about more academic topics covering a broad range of disciplines.
