I think you need to be prepared to search for materials outside of class as well to boost your retention of Korean
If you are interested in the language - especially improving your writing and speaking skills - this class is perfect.  You learn a lot of harder lever vocabulary, write many essays, and prepare numerous presentations.  The workload is pretty extensive with a lot of repetition.
This class has a very heavy culture-based focus. It moves away from the Korean language and tries to explore the different subtle layers of Korean culture.
With language classes, especially Korean classes, there is little to no leeway in terms of selecting classes.  Students who wish to take Korean at an advanced level have no choice but to take this class.  However, I would caution non-native speakers to be prepared for the challenges they will likely face in this class.  It's not easy and you might often feel frustrated because there isn't much structure and the abilities of your classmates are very diverse.  It's hard for the instructor to put together a comprehensive curriculum that caters to everyone's needs.  However, that being said, Kim Sunsaengnim was a very patient instructor who was more than willing to listen to and help students - she definitely does her best to integrate as many students into the class as possible.
Kim Mi-Hyun is an amazing professor.
