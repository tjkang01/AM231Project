Prof. Giron is one of the most passionate and knowledgable professors in FAS.
Luis is a brilliant professor, and the syllabus is very interesting. Low work load means you get to engage with the readings without high pressure to analyze every single one. Overall would highly recommend if you are interested in the subject.
Taking a class with Professor Girn-Negrn is a privilege. His wealth of knowledge and experience make this class like no other.
