Granara is quirky but very interested in his students, the readings were a lot of fun and the discussions were excellent. Probably a lot to do with who the other students were, but it was a great course.
Great class, especially if you're interested in the Middle East. The novels are really great as well as the themes around allegory.
This course is easily of my best courses at Harvard
To take it!
