Take this class! You will learn about profound and wonderful writers like Ezra Pound, Marinetti, and Soffici. There is also a way to deepen analysis skills by comparing poetry from one author, to dance and movement in other areas of performance. You will also meet wonderful people!
Very theoretical and involves close reading, but highly rewarding.
I think you need to be actually interested in exploring poetry and the concept of how dance an inform it to enjoy the material.
The class is valuable because of the discussion environment and the type of practice with writing it necessitates - writing eloquently but with concision (which also applies to the comments made in class).
