Wow. I came into this class with no real specific interest in the material but feel like I soaked up everything John said like a sponge. The course does a great job of framing thousands of years of history through the lens of a single mythological figure.
Professor Hamilton is enthusiastic and brilliant; the course is carefully put together, always engaging, not overly demanding, and very enlightening.
You have everything to gain and nothing to lose in taking this course. You will never again in your entire life get so much out of so little reading  it will really open your eyes to a fundamental Professor Hamilton is a riveting lecturer and a very kind man.
That you get a really amazing taste of a lot of different genres and historical time periods. I loved that we looked at prose, poetry, opera and film without it ever feeling overwhelming.
