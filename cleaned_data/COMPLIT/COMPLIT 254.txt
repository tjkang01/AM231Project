Great readings and materials! Kind of disorganized presentations.
Join this class if you already have some experience with modernism but want to dig deeper into the details of certain authors, artists, or musicians. Discussions tend to center around creative works, rather than the "polemic" side of the class--though that aspect is a helpful structuring principle. The presentation requirement genuinely adds interesting content and background to the course.
