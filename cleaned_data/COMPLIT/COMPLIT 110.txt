This is a great introductory course for anyone interested in Comparative Literature or literary theory. I loved everything we read, and it was great to spend four weeks on each set of works. You definitely have to like close reading- sometimes we would spend the whole class looking at one or two passages- but for me that was really refreshing (very different from other Enligsh/lit courses in which you read a book a week). Professor Gudon is also great! She's so passionate and really interested in getting to know her students.
For Woolf/Barthes/Borges loves, you cannot miss it. Very structured course with a great teacher.
