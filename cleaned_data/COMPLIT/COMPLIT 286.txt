The instructor is very dedicated to teaching. That does not happen often.
You'll get to read some really amazing and really foundational texts, under good guidance.
It's a lot of reading. Doing it is well worth it.
"Metaphor" is worth it, if you're willing. It gave me new ways of seeing things.
The class is extremely difficult, but the professor is willing to help students through the material.
