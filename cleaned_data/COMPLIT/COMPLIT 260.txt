Enjoyable readings (with some more difficult ones interspersed), and a great opportunity to look at cross-cutting themes and ideas in different literary traditions during the Renaissance and Baroque.
The course offers an extraordinary opportunity of reading  plays by Marlowe, Shakespeare and Caldern.
This class has a manageable to high workload, but with great benefits.  Professor Johnson is a trove of knowledge about the European Renaissance and Baroque periods and the drama produced during this time, and his discussions are enthusiastic and invigorating.
