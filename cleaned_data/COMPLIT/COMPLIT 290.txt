Great class with v. interesting teacher. If you're not sure at first, give it a chance. Prof shell has a lot to say. Would also recommend his Fictions of Kin and Kind class. My fave.
Professor Shell is wonderful, and he makes you think deeply about the art of translation. Listening and talking with him for 2 hours a week is an experience that hovers about the rest of your life, so that you understand that what is learned in the classroom is not meant to remain there.
