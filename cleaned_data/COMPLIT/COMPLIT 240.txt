Very simply, if you are interested in exploring the quality of sacred yearning in secular (modern) literature, thinking about it creatively, and discussing it comfortably, this course is for you.
I really enjoyed this class. Prof KZY is so much fun to talk to and always has a smart and articulate take on the material, and the discussion was always enjoyable. The class was very personal and nurturing; every meeting was more like a good conversation than a class. I always looked forward to it even though it was on a Friday afternoon. Take it if you're interested in the syllabus!
