This is a fantastic class to take if you're interested in any of the key issues. You'll come out with a firm grasp of trauma theory and the debates surrounding it, and you'll be lucky enough to have class with Professor Suleiman.
it will not be traumatic at all -- quite the opposite
It is difficult to find a course that focuses on these three things: trauma, memory and creativity.
Fascinating class. Covers a lot of material and you have to be comfortable/excited about talking about trauma. If you are, fully recommend the class!
This class is a great opportunity to work closely with a wonderful professor and gain exposure to a variety of works that most other classes or departments would deem impossible to study in conjunction with each other. A wonderful learning experience! Give yourself ample time to do all of the reading, especially the novels, as your education will be diminished without the insights you gain from your own readings.
