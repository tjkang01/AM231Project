I would highly recommend this class, but only to those who are willing to suffer in order to increase their understanding of Latin prose style. If you're interested in broader literary questions then other Latin courses will serve you better. Don't take the course simply because it has a reputation for being rigorous.
You learn a lot, but it's painful!
You must be very independent in this class.  Unless you go to the TF or professor for individual help, don't expect much specific instruction on improving on prose composition. You'll get plenty of practice through the weekly assignments and grow in your appreciation of philology and style, but your Latin may not improve a whole lot. The more effort you put into the compositions, the more you will get out of the course.
Latin K is extremely intense. Don't even think about it unless you've completed Latin H with a good grade or done the equivalent on your own, and even then approach with caution. It's not so hard writing Ciceronian Latin but in the latter part of the course, when you are asked to imitate Sallust and Tacitus, the grades will begin to droop as you have to sit up and take notice of minute details of diction. It is (reportedly) made more enjoyable and somewhat less demanding now that Thomas (whom I love) is teaching the course instead of Krebs.
This class is a lot of work, but is very rewarding.
Compositions are very fun but very difficult.  Great class overall.
The closest to a systematic close-reading of several prose authors available in any course; ideal continuation of Latin 201.
A bit of a slog at times to produce a composition each week, but worthwhile in bolstering your abilities in Latin. Best to get the requirement out of the way as soon as possible, and to put your increased familiarity with Latin to good use for generals.
