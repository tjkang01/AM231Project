Initially the amount of reading was a lot. Later, there was still sometimes too much to read through thoroughly.
If you want to read some of the less common Cicero works, this is a great opportunity to do so.  You have to read a fair amount for each class, though, so you should feel comfortable in your abilities to read fairly quickly.
Professor Barnes is fantastic, and his teaching methods and interests allowed me to take much more from Cicero than I was able to glean when I first read the Catilinarians in high school Latin.
It's a lot to read, but the class dynamic is really relaxed. Our Monday/Wednesday discussions were the highlight of my week.
