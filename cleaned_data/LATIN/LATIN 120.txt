RJT is a great professor, and it was a pleasure taking a class with him. Above all else, the material makes this class! The Satyricon doesn't always get the credit it deserves! Plus, who doesn't want to discuss Priapus in a scholarly setting?
Read Petronius.  He deals with the human condition in a hilarious way.  Plus, it's very hard to know exactly what to make of his work, and wrestling with what you think it should be is a good experience to go through.  Too often we are told what to think about art, but Prof. Tarrant doesn't push any specific interpretations, which is awesome.
This class is a great way to explore a work in Latin literature that is notorious but woefully underrepresented. It is primarily discussion based, which makes for some truly interesting conversations about The Satyricon.
This is an enjoyable class, on a Roman novel! and Prof. Tarrant is very good--and nice to be in class with. It is probably a small and informal group. I recommend this.
This is the only exam in recent memory that I have had fun studying for.  If this class is available, take it -- the text is brilliantly funny and vibrant.
