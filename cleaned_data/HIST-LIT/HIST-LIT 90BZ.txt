This class was my favorite class at Harvard.  It examined questions of meritocracy and Harvard that I had not thought about.  The class left me wanting to read more of the material in depth over winter break.  The professor genuinely cares about the class and students.
it's difficult- lots of reading
Personally, I think that every student enrolled at Harvard should take this class. It taught me to think critically about Harvard's history and the role I play in that history: the values it in inculcates it students; the image of meritocracy that it perpetuates; the way in which its students internalize the meritocratic rhetoric to carve their way into society's economic and cultural elite. Though history is not my primary passion, this class was one of the most rewarding that I've ever taken. Ryan is incredibly invested in making classroom discussion rich and the overcall class experience rewarding. I highly recommend!
