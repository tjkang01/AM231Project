Take a class with Nick! I'm going to repeat this in the teacher-specific section, but he's ridiculously nice and accessible and smart and seems to want to interact with undergrads (or else fakes it very well).. which is kind of rare. If this class is offered again, take this class! It was tiny this year and incredibly rewarding. You read a sizable amount and it's a deeply considered syllabus. I looked forward to class.
Excellent course! Nick is great and the syllabus is extremely engaging. Our class was very small, so the course would be better with a larger enrollment (with respect to discussion).
