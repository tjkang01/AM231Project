Most of the instructions for assignments were VERY vague. It was frustrating because they make you think that they don't have many expectations for what you turn in but they actually are VERY picky about EVERYTHING. Don't take this class if you're not comfortable with the aforementioned. Be ready for VERY critical evaluations, and to not understand anything that goes on in the class or in section as not much effort is made to decipher the abstraction. The TF is amazing, kind, and supportive. The lecturer was intimidating, unapproachable.
Be careful about the sarcasms used by the teacher.
