it's an interesting course, and you will learn a lot - but most of what you really learn will be about the subject of the wikipedia page you're required to create (that's the final project.)
Great material, great professor, fantastic projects.
It's cool because we read almost all the primary and a lot of secondary sources from the time of Charlemagne, so you get to construct the history yourself.
The Wikipedia project was the highlight of the course.  Very interesting approach to a final project.
Great course, Professor Gilsdorf is awesome and you really bond with your class mates. It was an amazing course
