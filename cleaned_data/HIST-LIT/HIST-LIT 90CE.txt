I would strongly recommend this class. It is one of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard. The readings are all very interesting and Erin is a great teacher. If you are interested in learning more about  the civil war through much more interesting means than reading a text book you should take this class.
This was a casual and deeply stimulating course. The readings were excellently chosen and interesting. Like other HL90s, the class was centered completely around open discussion.
great course to explore historical literature during the Civil War, very rewarding if you put in the hours!
This course is a fascinating look into the literary, cultural, and political landscapes of the Civil War-era United States. The primary sources encompass a wide variety of literary traditions and provide great insight into the era.
