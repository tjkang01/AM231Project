It's a great introduction to the (sometimes crazy) world of material history.
This class is not so much focused on the home as it is on the structure of American houses. It focuses largely on the function of house museums rather than the function of the home in history. There is a lot of reading (frequently over 400 pages a week) that at times can be incredibly dense. Although the paper assignments are enjoyable, discussion in seminar is often disjointed and hard to follow. It may just be that I was not particularly interested in the topic, but this class was hard to get through.
It's a great, reading and writing-intensive seminar. The field trips were a lot of fun, and I wouldn't have gone any of those places outside of the class.
You should only take this course if you are interested in Colonial homes and their interiors.
THe class is a good introduction to the discipline of material culture and allows you to look at history from a unique angle. If you love museums then you'll love this class. If you think they are boring this class probably won't be your thing.
If you need a colonial course for H&L America this one is good but be aware the subject matter isn't everyone's cup of tea and there are a lot of field trips.
