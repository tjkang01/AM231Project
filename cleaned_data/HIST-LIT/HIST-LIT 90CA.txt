This course enhances your knowledge of the underground world of cocaine, including production, trade, important actors, and current issues of the drug.  A very comprehensive guide to understanding the development of the drug historically, politically, and in today's world.
A great opportunity to engage with a subject seldom discussed in other classes. Through the lens of cocaine, this course allows you to explore the historical ties between a number of Latin American countries. You will also tackle some interesting contemporary issues concerning U.S. drug policy and mass incarceration. Ezer is an excellent leader of discussion, and happy to help you with your assignments outside of class. Assignments offer great opportunities for work independently and think creatively
I would warn students that this is a Hist-Lit class, so it is important to view and understand the material through a Hist-lit perspective
