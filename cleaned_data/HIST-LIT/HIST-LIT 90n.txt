Would recommend for those with either an interest in the subject matter (18th-19th c. America) or an interest in exploring history and literature.
Great 19th Century hist/lit requirement.
Not every reading is going to be exciting but the ones you love, you will really love.
A very engaging seminar.
Be prepared to work, but to get a lot out of this class.
