This class is a great opportunity to study a region that is underserved in academic discourse. The readings are all engaging, and the load is relatively light.
This is a great intro course to the history and literature department and is part of the reason why I decided to concentrate in hist and lit. The history of the Caribbean is not usually taught in high school or in general history courses, so it is really cool to get a chance to study the Caribbean so specifically. Having Achy Obejas and Junot Diaz talk to us after we read their novels was also an amazing experience.
If your interested in the caribbean, it's a must; if you're not, then you will be.
This course was a mess. The assignments and homework were unclear, and little to no help was available. The subject matter may sound interesting, but I didn't feel like I actually learned much about it. The professor didn't seem to care about the course at all. Don't take it.
It's very informative about something you probably did not have extensive instruction about prior
