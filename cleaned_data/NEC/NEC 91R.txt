If you have the chance to do an independent study (or take any other class) with Irit, I enthusiastically recommend it. She is a brilliant and patient and encouraging teacher and both my language abilities and interest in Hebrew literature grew tremendously this semester. It was such a privilege to get to take this independent study class with Irit!
Irit is a great instructor and conversationalist.
NEC 91r is a fantastic opportunity to have 1:1 (or in our case, 2:1) interaction with a professor in an area of their specialty and your interest in order to produce original thought. Please take at least one such course during your time at Harvard.
I really hope this course gets offered again! I have never felt so much progress in a single semester in arabic as I did this semester. A lot of that is probably work I put in out of class but this class was very motivating in wanting to put that work in as well, as the workload wasn't extremely high. I think a lot of people at my level (and higher levels) of arabic would really benefit!
