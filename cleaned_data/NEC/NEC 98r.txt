This course is a great way to be introduced to the controversies of studying in this field, and to engage with such important material as Said, Montesquieu and Adbel-Malik. Professor Harris constructs a great class atmosphere, and is encouraging and available all the time.
An interest in the Middle East is an obvious and necessary prerequisite to enjoying this course.
The NELC junior tutorial is an interesting class in that discussions tend to be very open and participants are very relaxed. Professor Harris is also very helpful when it comes to answering questions and concerns and I hope he teaches the class next year.
