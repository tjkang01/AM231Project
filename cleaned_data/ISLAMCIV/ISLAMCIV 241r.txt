Not always enjoyable (especially the material), but gives decent exposure to current popular trends in the study of Islam in South Asia. Best if taken together with Professor Asani's more general "Islam in South Asia" beforehand.
The class is critical approach to understanding the issues, historic and modern, that affect studies of South Asian Islam.
Both to better understand Indo-Islamic history and culture and to get an idea of how scholarship on a particular topic can evolve over time this is a very helpful course.
