A highly productive course for anyone wishing to pursue Islamic studies at a graduate level.
It is extremely well taught.
This has definitely been one of my favorite classes at Harvard. Professor Zeghal takes the question of knowledge production seriously, and guides you through the literature such that you may understand how the question has been constructed and answered over various scholarly areas and in different fields. It really added depth to the way I engage with Islam and productions of scholarship in the area.
The course provides a great foundation for future research on the ulama/Islamic education.
This class, though very specific, was very interesting as well as very helpful for those students interested in the issue of Islamic education in the Middle East.
This class draws on compelling readings about religious scholars and education in the Middle East, with a focus on the modern period. The course is based on class discussion, and the heaviest part of the workload comes from the extensive reading list. It is manageable, however. This is a great class to take to be in a small graduate seminar with Professor Zeghal.
If you want hands-on advice and working tools to help you improve your research skills in Arabic and Islamic studies, this seminar is a must.
