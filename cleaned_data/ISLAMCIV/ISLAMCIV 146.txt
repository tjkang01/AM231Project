Rouayheb is amazing at helping you to understand the most complex of Ghazali's thoughts. He's always open to hearing and discussing with students. Take this class! So interesting.
It's a class with great exposure to an important and influential Islamic thinker -- many young Muslims look up to Ghazali today.
Students interested in Islamic studies really must take this course because of the content and because the professor is excellent.
Fascinating material. There aren't many courses at Harvard which really delve into medieval philosophy, but this is one of them. If you keep up with the readings, it's not hard, but the course definitely takes time and investment.
