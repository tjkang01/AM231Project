This is a great class. Professor Graham is a terrific teacher and he really has a wonderful way of talking about spirituality in general and about the spiritual dimensions to the Qur'anic text in particular. This class really helped me develop a way of thinking about religion and religiosity that tries to go beyond some of the more superficial arguments that abound in social science today. Professor Graham is also very accessible in and outside of class, gives great feedback, and has a masterful command of the literature. He wants to make this course work for you - which is why, even though our seminar group was quite big (about 35 people), I still learned a great deal. I definitely recommend this class.
This course provides an excellent intro to a central component of Islamic culture.

I was expecting this class to be an approach to the Quran from a scholarly standpoint, much like the classes raught here on the Hebrew Bible: a thorough introduction to the literature of the Quran and the Western scholarship on it, from its formation to its literary devices, theological meanings and so forth. This class was partially about that - but it also spent a great deal of time on how the Quran is used in later Islamic tradition, e.g. in tafseer and Sufism. That would be appropriate - in an introdcution to Islam class. I still took this class because there really isn't another course taught here on the Quran from a historical-critical standpoint; there really should be. There should be more than one, more than just an introduction, just as there are in the study of other religious texts.Also, this was supposed to be a seminar, but since over 40 people were signed up, it became essentially a Q&A session with the professor until the idea arose to split for the second hour into two smaller groups; if this arises again, I'd recommend doing that from the beginning, and for the full two hours.
