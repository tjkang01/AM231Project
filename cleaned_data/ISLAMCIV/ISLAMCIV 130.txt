Islamization and Vernacularization (ISLAMCIV 130) exceeded my expectation in every single way. The teaching is thorough and well organized and the support you receive is reassuring.
You need to know about Islam in Southeast Asia. Not knowing about it is like not knowing about Christianity in Europe. I wish this class was taught as a gen-ed. Prof.Feener is so funny and knowledgeable, and the material is fascinating, and you basically meet 2 hours a week and have 1 written assignment, which gives you a chance to do a lot of your own research for the final paper under the guidance of the professor. You really feel like you are in the region and producing your own scholarship, and i have never felt this way in any of my other classes. It is fantastic, and if it is being offered, please take it, it will change your life.
This class will give you a great introduction to the world of Southeast Asian Islam.  But beyond both Islam and Southeast Asia, the class raises pertinent questions for anyone about the form and mutability of culture.  And what it means (or doesn't) to think about culture in discreet units.
