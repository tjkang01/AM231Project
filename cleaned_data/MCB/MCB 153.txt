you will realize that you can understand deep underlying principles that govern life armed with only a platinum wire, a nematode (make that thousands of nematodes), and creativity.
This is a great genetics laboratory course. It does require some dedication to maintaining your cultures and organizing your experiments. But the payoff in terms of the knowledge and expertise obtained from this class  was great.Take if you are in, or are considering entering a genetics lab. Also take if you want to learn a great deal about RNAi and its discovery; there are a lot of fascinating discoveries in the RNAi field that many other biology classes typically gloss over.
This class was an amazing and challenging opportunity to delve right into real research and make an impact on an active research project. I learned SO much about both genetics and basic lab techniques. The class was small when I took it and so I had the opportunity to work closely with the professor and TF and ask questions. Whether or not you've done extensive research or not, you can make the work fit your background. So, if you're looking for a first laboratory experience or just looking to better understand a new field, this is a great option.You will think a lot about classical genetics, but your results and work may break the mold of expectations and will prompt you to logically analyze your data and draw from a great breadth of biologic understanding. In addition to lab, you will closely read a variety of literature in the related field. I really like that my experiments directly contributed to the topics formally taught and discussed in the class portion of MCB 153. STRONGLY consider taking this class over ls100r or a related generic lab course.Also, worms are awesome and fun!
