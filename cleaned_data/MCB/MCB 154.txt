This course covers a broad range of current biological issues and this helped me put my own research in perspective.
Great and interesting topics covered in this course, complemented with a really great professor. Great opportunity for discussion of studies in depth. Definitely consider this class.
This is a great discussion-based class that covers a lot of interesting topics in cell biology.
It's a great discussion class in a small-group environment that will teach you to read more critically and grapple with how scientists resolve disagreements. It's much more real in that sense than some of the earlier MCB/CPB course requirements. There's not too much work outside of reading the papers carefully and doing two projects (one more creative, one a typical term paper). Professor Mango is very supportive of undergrads and interested in what we're involved in.
it's hard, but worth it.  start early on the long term assignments
This class allows you to really engage in the material. Instead of being taught at, you are encouraged to learn hands on from reading and critiquing science journals. The papers assigned are also on controversial questions, so you really feel like you're part of the debate!
This is a great MCB 100 level course.  Prof. Mango is really nice and approachable.  The topics covered are diverse and interesting.  Be prepared to participate in class (a lot) because it's run as a discussion and debate.  You will learn a lot about different cell processes as well as the techniques used to study them.
