Read the papers, and participate! Make sure you get started on your final project early so that you are not scrambling towards reading period days.
I was very excited about taking this course but I was sorely disappointed by the change in structure from guest lecturers (which seemed great considering the previous Q comments) to student run lectures. I would not recommend taking this class if students are still in charge of presenting the papers. Many of the papers are not conducive to interesting discussion and the discussion was consistently focused on the negative.
Unless the class is substantially restructured to have more student feedback, better organization and contextualization of content, and presentations by faculty, I can't recommend taking this class, barring you already have a fairly good grasp on reading papers and connectomics, and are really interested by those questions.
Joint Harvard/MIT world-class faculty and fellow students, frontier of neurobiology research, hands-on experience with real EM data, this is THE course to take whenever possible!
wow!  an assault of information!
Classes are essentially lab meetings. It could be a little daunting for undergraduates.
Inspiring.  Get to see cutting edge technology harnessed to solve the most important scientific questions of the twenty-first century -- how the brain works.  Great teaching team.  Worthwhile project at end -- write a faux-grant under the guidance of the investigators who do this all the time (with flying colors).
Take it if you have any interest in structure-function relationships and neuroscience.
worth taking if you're interested in neural circuits!
