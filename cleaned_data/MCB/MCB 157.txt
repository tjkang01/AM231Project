This course is very interesting and you will learn a lot about the process of scientific discovery in genetics and the history of scientific discovery in this field. In addition, you will become much more comfortable reading papers. Be ready to write and read a lot, however.
If you want to do genetics, or any life sciences really, you should take this course. Not only will you gain massive insight into how genetics research has been done past and present but you will learn how to read papers.
I highly recommend this class: the class is really about learning how to read and critically review primary literature through the lens of developmental biology. Professor Hunter does an excellent job facilitating a critical discussion of the papers. Though his knowledge of the field is outstanding, he doesn't overwhelm the discussion with his knowledge, and he does an amazing job at encouraging us to form our own opinions of the paper.
Be prepared to spend a lot of time reading and writing. This class is set up like a journal club where you discuss up to three articles a week. You will learn the most from the assigned papers, so read them carefully.
