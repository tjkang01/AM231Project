This was a fantastic course. I would recommend it to anyone.
Prof. Harrison is a fantastic teacher, and this class is a really wonderful overview of Fourier optics and the theory of modern microscopy and crystallography techniques.  If you have any interest in structural biology, I strongly recommend this course.
