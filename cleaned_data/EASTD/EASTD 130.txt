Don't miss it. Besides a time-machine, Professor Owen might be the only person who could take you back to the Tang Dynasty.
Professor Owen is brilliant. The greatest pleasure was hearing him walk us through a poem; his use of language and grasp of literature is precise, careful, and rewarding. Do as much of the readings as you can, but try to absorb the most in lectureshe is a fun and funny lecturer.
In this course, participation is 35%, and the final paper is 65% of your grade. However, since you only get 1 paper--the final paper--you really need to know what you want to write about for the paper and start your own research early, consult with the professors a few times to see if your topic is appropriate (he knows best what materials are out there and not out there for your topic), and reach a consensus on a topic early--if you want a paper with some quality you can attest to, that is. Do NOT do the last-minute research and paper-writing thing. As for readings, it is around 120-150 pages per week, or 60-70 pages per class. The time taken for the readings depends on your obsession with accuracy--are you going to spend tie Googling every Chinese name mentioned in the reading to see exactly which historic figures are being mentioned, or not. If you don't skim, but do careful reading, it would take time. If you're not familiar with a particular subject, it will take time. Must do the readings--they help you determine what topic you want to work on during finals, and you also need to submit discussion questions based on the readings for every class. However, it is a very interesting class because we don't just cover things from a historical perspective, but from anecdotes on the daily lives of the Tang people, deductions on what lives and thoughts were going through the Tang people's minds, and speculations about what certain things happened a certain way. You'd have a new take on religion in Tang China after you take this course.
