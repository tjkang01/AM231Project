You'll learn a lot about an aspect of China, minority history and politics, that is often disregarded because the Chinese population is heavily homogenous. Workload is light.
Great course if you want to learn about a different aspect of China. The workload is perfect: not too much reading and not little enough reading that it becomes super easy. You will learn a lot
Loved it! Great discussions! amazing professor!
Professor Jeong is incredibly nice and encouraging -- make sure you take advantage of her OH.
discussion is essential
