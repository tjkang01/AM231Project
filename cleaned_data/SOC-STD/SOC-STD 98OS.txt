The class deals with incredibly rich and complex ideas. Great teaching and selection of readings make them reasonable and enjoyable.
When I took this class there were only 3 students in it, and it's difficult for me to imagine exactly what this course would be like with a bigger group because the conversation was so rooted in how small it was and the fact that I really liked both of the other people in the class. That said, if it's offered again with a similarly small set of individuals, then I would highly recommend it.I would say to only take the course if you get really excited when you look at the list of the course readings. The topic of transparency and honesty in politics is interesting through a lot of different lenses, but week to week the conversation was generally centered on that week's readings rather than the broader ways of looking at transparency and honesty in politics. So if you don't have much interest in Machiavelli/Hobbes/Rousseau on their own merits and only take the course because question of honesty and transparency in contemporary politics, you'll probably be disappointed.
This is a challenging course on rhetoric and its function in a political democracy. It is also investigates different methods used to evaluate historical thinkers.
