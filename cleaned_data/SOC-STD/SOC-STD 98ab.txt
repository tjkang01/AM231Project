Small seminar style class on the intersection of democracy and science. You really gain a new perspective of science throughout history and its interactions with politics and society. I took this class as a non-Social Studies concentrator and still found the readings and discussions engaging. There are about 4-5 readings every week along with weekly responses -- fairly manageable. There is one research essay on a topic of your choice, which I found enjoyable to write. Prof. Jewett leads great discussions and also provides good feedback on essays.
The material is very theoretical, but Professor Jewett wants to help you to understand it. Definitely get to know him and ask him clarifying questions. It will likely be a small tutorial, as it has been the past few times.
An amazing seminar analyzing the role of science in society here in America.  Goes across a number of key issues and draws themes between them all.  Not too much reading and one can take a lot away from it.
