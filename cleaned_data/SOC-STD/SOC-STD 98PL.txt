If you want a course you enjoy going to every week, where you are consistently intellectually challenged, and always come away with the feeling that you have learned a lot -- this class is for you!
Incredible class with awesome discussions. Take it if you're able to do the work (~1 book/wk). I came away with a much greater understanding of historical methods, the limitations of conducting history, notions of culture, modernity, colonialism, and imperial domination. Daragh led riveting seminars, and class discussions that gave me a lot to think about throughout the week.
A fair amount of reading, but well worth it!
The course includes a lot of content relating to historiography, and in general was much more theoretical than I at least expected it to be.
