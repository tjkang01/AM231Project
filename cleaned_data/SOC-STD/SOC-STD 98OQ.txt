The material in this class was great, and while at times it was a little abstract, it generated awesome discussions in class. Adam is the man; he's super knowledgeable, really approachable, and just downright fun to be in class with.
This class will give you such a great theoretical background to rhetoric. You will also gain an appreciation for just how much rhetorical abilities effect everything.
Good class to start thinking about rhetoric in the context of more modern speeches. There's a good balance between older texts, like Gorgias or Aristotle's "On Rhetoric", and newer excerpts, as from Frederick Douglass or Lyndon B. Johnson.
