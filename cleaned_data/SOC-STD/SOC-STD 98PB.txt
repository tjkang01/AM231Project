Really interesting class, lots of readings, Kristin is a bit of a hard grader, but is super kind about giving her time to her students. Glance through the readings to see if this class is for you.
Kristin is a great tutorial leader! She is an absolutely pleasure to learn from.
Great course that analyzes poverty at a global scale but gets nitty-gritty on specific theories and dimensions of daily life. Kristin is sharp and energetic.
