This course is really interesting if you are interested in democratic theory, but be prepared to have a bit more freedom than you might be used to in other tutorials. This is a good or bad thing depending on the way you work, so just keep that in mind. Otherwise Dr. Storey is really great at engaging with students and being available to talk outside of class.
Great course for engaging with a lot of democratic theorists and their different philosophical underpinnings, as democratic theory has evolved.
fantastic background in American democratic theory, its contemproraru challenges, and great lens through which we can analyze current politics
Your enjoyment of this class is almost entirely dependent on who else takes it. The tutorials are only as good as the people who participate in the class discussions.
