Great, challenging class, which encourages participation and challenges preconceived notions of financial markets. I would recommend this for anyone interested in challenging the assumptions of neoclassical economics and for anyone interested in understanding how financial markets really work.
Anush is fantastic.  Although he lectures a little too much sometimes, he truly has a unique perspective and one worth hearing.  Take this course.
Definitely background in higher-than-Ec10 economics course required. I was totally unprepared. Learned a lot, but did not feel comfortable contributing frequently to discussion. Anush is fantastic, and the other students in the course challenged me a lot.
Anush is a great teacher, and you will certainly take a lot away from your experience in this tutorial.
