Might be a little too political-theory based if that's not what you're into. Otherwise, Matt's a great guy who really cares about his students.
The course covers a wide range of topics for those with diverse interests.
If you are interested at all in the topics of science, power and democracy (either some of these topics or all of them in conjunction) I definitely think that you should take this course! The readings that we do are incredibly interesting and thought provoking. Furthermore, this is such an all encompassing topic that it bridges many interests and disciplines and is therefore very appealing.
The theoretical questions posed in this class are interesting ones--who creates the knowledge we regard as scientific? is science objective? Matt writes these outlines that really help guide the discussion in productive ways. As a social studies concentrator, it was also great to meet students who were similarly interested in interdisciplinary studies, but from a scientific orientation. This was also the perfect class to get started on my thesis chapter, though my topic could have fit within the purviews of other tutorials as well. Matt is really chill, non-intimidating, and makes you want to do the readings for readings sake. Could have been a bit stronger in terms of coming away feeling strongly about what you are reading/talking about, but if you are looking for a low-stress, friendly tutorial, this is where you will find it.
