This is a great junior tutorial with a great professor who gives great feedback! Though if you already took Anya'a tutorial on inequality, the readings might feel repetitive.
Professor McClendon makes it awesome/stress-free. You learn a lot about both the material and writing/research. Great for thesis preparation on any type of inequality.
This class is hands down one of the most enjoyable and particularly formative classes that I have taken here at Harvard these last three years. Professor McClendon is phenomenal, and the material is beyond interesting through many different perspectives.
Amazing Social Studies tutorial - the readings are all really fascinating as is the course structure generally. Professor McClendon is really great at weaving all of the readings into the discussion in a way that doesn't feel forced at all. She's also really supportive and helpful with final projects, and is open to various ideas/methods. Overall, a phenomenal experience!
