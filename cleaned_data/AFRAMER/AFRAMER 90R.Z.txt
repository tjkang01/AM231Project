This is a great class! If you want to develop a close relationship with the professor and at the same time learn one of the most fascinating african languages, I recommend you consider taking this course. Lingala is a very interesting language, easy to learn. The teacher is a great person and you will appreciate meeting him. the class is usually very small which means you definitely a friends in this course. Like most languages, it is important to remember that in order to improve your skills you need to be a proactive learner and be enthusiastic. African Night was my highlight of this course, I liked the opportunity of composing a skit to present to other students taking other african languages.
Take this course! If you're looking for a 5th course to add on.. TAKE IT! It's super easy, but you still gain a lot! Prof is super understanding!
after a semester of this course, you'll have a great grasp on basic Lingala!
This is a good class if you are interested in one day going to the Congo.
particularly in a class so small, students ought to have a good idea of what it is they would like to accomplish in the course in order to move forward at a good pace.
Opportunity to learn a language of cultural importance
super helpful course to learn more about popular culture in DR Congo, Angola, and Congo Brazzaville!
