This class is really interesting, but there is very little structure (i.e. no syllabus on the course site). This can be a good and a bad thing, as the class does not have much work, but the student is left unaware of their progress throughout the course. There are only two papers (not sure about how much they count for), so the workload is extremely low.
The class is unstructured, so be prepared.
The experience really depends on the TF
This class is a good course to take if you want to engage in interesting topic without an overly cumbersome workload.
The movies are awesome, the lectures are decent. Course isnt too difficult, but a little up in the air about where grading is if that is a concern. You should familiarize yourself a bit with the history of African American portrayal on media. Course could be improved by teaching more about cinematography. All in all, a pretty fun elective.
Fun professor with great films to analyze
It's a great class! I loved it! Definitely worth taking.
