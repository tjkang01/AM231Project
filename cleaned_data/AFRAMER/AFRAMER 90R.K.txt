The class is good, but be ready for spontaneity. You will have to do a lot of work outside of class to truly get a good control of the language.
I love the African Language Program: get three people to take a language and you can take it. The teacher of this particular class had a lot on her mind, and it did have an effect on her teaching. I expect, however, that these issues will have (one way or another) resolved themselves by next semesterand I nevertheless came out of the class learning a pretty decent amount of a beautiful language. Therefore, I would encourage anyone with an interest in Luganda to take the class.
The class is what you make it. You bring your own interest into studying the language.
The class is fun, but make sure to keep very organized notes for test taking.
Great course if you want a fun and interesting elective!
The class is fun and you learn a lot about Luganda and Ugandan culture!
The teacher is awesome and will guide you through the process of learning the language even when you feel like you haven't learned much. Also, Mugane is very cool and comes in occasionally to check on your progress.
This is an excellent Luganda course. The language is fascinating - and the instructor is great.
Fun fun!
I highly recommend the Luganda course to everyone I know. It is a beautiful language.
This is a great course if you have any interest in learning the Luganda language.
