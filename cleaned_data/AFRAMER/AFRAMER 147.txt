The readings are great and Professor Bobo presents material in a very thorough and engaging manner.
It is a great class.
Take the class, but be careful if you're the kind of student that needs a lot of structure.
The readings are dense but class discussions are very interesting.
I would tell them the course is great if you love politics or are interested in taking a course taught by Professor Bobo: >
It's easy, pretty interesting.  Probably not rigorous enough for concentrators.
this class provided a great balance of background information for the studies of both race and politics separately, along with awesome details about the intersection of the two.  i strongly recommend it!  professor bobo is awesome.
This is a great class. Lawrence Bobo is a great professor. Take this class!
This is one of the top two best classes I've taken at Harvard
The success of the class depends on how willing people are to get into the details and really debate them in class. Discussion has to be prolific.
