Enjoyable but difficult class. Flexible to your interests.
This is a great class for native speakers. A more organized curriculum would have been more helpful!
This class is really great! It teaches you a language that is hardly taught anywhere else in America! The teacher really has your best interest at heart!
All students should take this class if you are eager to learn a new language or build off your previous knowledge because the class engaging and has a lot to offer.
Communicate your needs to your teacher from the very beginning. Be honest about your trouble areas and what things you'd like to review again. The teacher is great -- just make sure you utilize her effectively.
