If students are interested specifically in Black and White relations in the U.S., this course would be helpful. However, the spontaneous presentations can be frustrating when conversation stalls.
This class requires a lot of preparation, because, at the beginning of class, students are randomly chosen to lead class discussion.  This is a great class, but quite a bit of work required.  Plan for the op-ed to take quite a bit of time to compose, unless you are already accustomed to that type of writing.
