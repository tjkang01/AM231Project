The readings might seem a lot but they are deep, rich and you'll love them. Just set aside enough time to do them. Prof Olupona and Oludamini are fantastic teaching staff.
This class is extremely interesting in terms of the material, but a little to lecture-heavy. Nonetheless, utilize office hours and you will get the most out of this class.
This is a wonderful course.
This course is fantastic, and Prof. Olupona is one of those old school, old country teachers that they just don't make anymore. You will learn so much in this course, if you do the readings. Do yourself a favor and do the readings! You might be able to get by without doing the readings, but you will learn SO much more if you keep up with the readings.
I think this is a great class for people with a personal interesting in religion, its interaction with politics, or Nigeria in general. I would be sure to shop the class beforehand to see how busy it is. The class was, material- and assignment-wise, great. However, I think it was slightly hindered by a large class size and reduced discussion time.
Professor Olupona is a great professor that really cares about students engaging with the material. Sometimes he can get ahead of himself, but it forces you to ask further questions about religion in Nigeria that makes you excited to approach the final paper.
