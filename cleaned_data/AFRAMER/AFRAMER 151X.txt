Cool course and material but bad organization and structure. Out syllabus was never finished and there was a constant feeling of what the hell is going on
Professor Morgan is a highly knowledgeable and approachable professor. Readings were VERY light and enjoyable, and Morgan's lectures were very interactive. The classes felt very much like an open discussion forum between students and professor. Other than the final group research project, which requires substantial planning and work outside of class, the 3 response papers are very short and low-stress. Take this class if you are a fan of hip-hop music and are at all interested in deepening your knowledge of its themes and messages about activism!
If you love hip-hop and want to see the social and political impact of a modern day art form this is the class to take
It is a very relevant and interesting course.
This class is interesting, and extremely easy.
The course is great and low stress. You'll read great sources on hiphop, activism, and black sociopolitical ideologies. Plus, the group projects were fun!
Even though this course definitely needed more cohesion and suffered a bit, the subject matter is still worth it.  Also gaining connections to the Hip Hop Archives and the hip hop academic community
Very low-stress course. It helps to have a knowledge of hip-hop and rap
this class is SO EXTREMELY EASY. we literally just chill and talk about old school hiphop and modern artists
Definitely take it if you love Hiphop music.
