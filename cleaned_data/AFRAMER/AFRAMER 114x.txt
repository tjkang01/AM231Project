Taking this class was the best decision I made this semester. It was fun, interesting and engaging. Carla is a great teacher and really seems to care about her students. It was awesome to get to interact so closely with the professor, because of the course's small size.
Excellent class if you have any interest in the Portuguese-speaking world. The music is amazing, the readings are interesting and the strong emphasis on multimedia means you won't just be writing boring response papers or reading dry academic texts. If you're interested in new media, this is a great class to learn how to produce academic presentations and papers about it.
