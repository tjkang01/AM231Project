Professor Morgan is a great teacher.  She is funny, but she loves to talk.  She loves to tell stories, watch videos, and listen to music in class.  The topics were interesting and made me look at things in life differently.  Also section was pretty easy because we just summarized the readings and discussed the topics.  The essays were easy too, because you could turn them in whenever.  A really chill class.  And the Hip Hop Archives are cool.
