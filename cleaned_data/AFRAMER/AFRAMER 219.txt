This course was an absolutely wonderful experience. Professor de la Fuente is both so learned and engaging, and a great discussion leader. In terms of the curriculum, the readings are quite wide ranging  chronologically, thematically, and methodologically. This course is a great introduction to histories of race and ethnicity, slavery and indigenous movements for those who might be already familiar with some of those topics in a different context (e.g. the United States). The final paper is also a good opportunity to draft an article or chip away at dissertation research.
