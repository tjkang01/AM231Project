I think this class is what you make of it. Since few of the members of my cohort are social scientists, our discussions were fairly limited.
This class is largely about exposure to wide range of issues and debates within African and African American Studies. You will be helped by a willingness to think in these broad terms rather than in seeking depth in one disciplinary field or another.
I learned a whole lot about the aims and methods of social science research.  I will definitely think more about the quantitative aspects of my own research as a result.
A great introduction to social science methods, but the course is not set up for students to get hands on experience with this type of research.
Come to learn the breadth of the field!
This course offers a forum to learn more about the different research interests of AAAS professors.
I really appreciated both first-year proseminars because they provided a great first impression and overview of what faculty's interests, research, and publications.
This class will give you a general view about different topics that professors are working on in the Department. You will have the opportunity to discuss with them your ideas and reactions.
It is a requirement for AAAS first year graduate students. A more relaxed course than it's pre-req, 301.
Professor Sidanius is a brilliant guide through the speakers and respective research projects he has lined up for the semester. While a required course, AAAS 302 was enjoyable, interesting in its diversity of academic approaches and disciplinary perspectives. Thank you!
