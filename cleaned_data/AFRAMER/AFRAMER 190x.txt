I highly recommend taking this course! As an undergraduate, I was slightly nervous, however Professor Comaroff is very approachable, and I learned an enormous amount from him and my fellow students. One of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard!
Challenging material but worth it because Professor Comaroff is one of the best at Harvard and one of the nicest.
Professor Comaroff is genius. What comes out of his mouth is pure gold and and absolutely riveting to listen to. You're not going to find a more articulate and exciting lecturer in all of Harvard.
Read the recommended background readings as suggested! Take good notes on Comaroff's lectures.
Take this class! Professor Comaroff is an amazing resource, and you discuss fascinating subjects.
the course is taught in a very theoretical fashion. The readings are quite accessible.
Professor Comaroff is amazing.  He doesn't speak in sentences, paragraphs or pages, but in whole chapters.  Never heard him place a word wrong.  Provided a theoretical explanation for much I've recognized in the law from practice and intuition.
Professor Comaroff is fantastic and the subject riveting
If you're interested in the anthropology of law, including theory and experiential cases, this course is  a great course to take.
This is an absolutely extraordinary course experience.  Professor Comaroff is an incredibly compelling lecturer and mentor.  If you are considering, absolutely take this course!
