I very much enjoy learning Malagasy. Antonio is an excellent instructor. I am grateful to him for teaching and to Professor Mugane for leading this program and Theater Night.
Focus on vocabulary on your own to make learning grammar and pronunciation easier.
Antonio is a wonderful person, and a great person from which to learn about Madagascar. This class is also fairly easy coursework wise. However, not a lot of direction is given in terms of how to actually practice Malagasy as a language.
Malagasy is a beautiful (and challenging) language, and this is a great course. Antonio is an excellent instructor and a good guy.
