Very interesting, very personalized, fairly disorganized.
This excellent for some students, discombobulating for others.
it is a nice, calm way to do a tutorial.  thats for sure.  Don't expect to be babied, you definitely make the class what you will, but you won't fail if you just cruise.  Win-win to me.
Blier is fantastic - very easy going and very open to creative ideas. The course itself is wonderful. You pick a city to study all term, write blog posts every week about a different aspect, and then write a final paper at the end. Great class.
There are a lot of really cool things about this class. You learn to rectify maps and overlay them onto satellite imagery, which is awesome. You learn a lot of history and sociological concepts relevant to urbanism in Africa, which is sometimes dry but usually really interesting. You also get really in-depth knowledge of the city you choose to study, which for me, at least, was challenging but worth every bit of effort I put into it. Highly recommended.
Great way to explore your own interests within the context of African cities. Great interdisciplinary class.
Free form and pleasantly random.
Great class! Very individualized and engaging :)
It's helpful if you just want to know about basic information of African cities
This is a great way for students with little knowledge about African cities to begin learning about a city in depth.
