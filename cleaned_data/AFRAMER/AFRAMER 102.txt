it's wonderful! ralph is super laid back and really smart.
It's a good class an alot of fun.
Incredibly interesting, lecture isn't that strong but the information presented is incredibly interesting.
You will really enjoy this class.
The class provides an entirely different perspective on hip-hop's relevance to politics today.
This class is really interesting, as long as you participate and engage in lectures.
This is an amazing course where the focus is learning and assignments are not stressful and the readings are fantastic
If you're looking a class to truly grapple with the morality of the hip-hop generation than this is the class for you.
This is a course with fascinating readings and films but a dry and boring professor who is not enthused about the material he's teaching and worse, takes that out on the class. This course is mad easy--no section, no weekly response papers even--so if you take this to be an easy class, you definitely won't be disappointed. However, if you have a genuine interest in the subject, you are likely to be disappointed. Being assigned a fascinating set of readings then sitting through a 2 hour lecture delivered in a monotone was terrible. And since there's no section, the only time you discuss readings if you happen to take this class with a friend and then discuss course themes outside of class. Unacceptable.
This class is very interesting and the workload is very manageable.  If you have even the slightest interest in hip-hop, or want to learn more about the politics of hip-hop, this is a phenomenal class to take.
Have an open mind to the potential of hip hop to open up your mind
