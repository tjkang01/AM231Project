This class was awesome but I think it would have been better if more AAAS concentrators had been in it.
The subject matter for this course was really interesting and relevant; Carla is a great teacher who makes a conscious effort to keep assignments interesting and to root the course material in real life issues (no ivory towers here). We also got to listen to some amazing speakers, people at the forefront of their fields in social technologies. Basically the course looked both at how familiar digital tools and spaces can be problematic, and how digital tools and spaces can be and are being used in new innovative ways to improve scholarly research, social & health initiatives both domestically and abroad, crowd-funding projects, etc. Sometimes it didn't really feel as though the week-to-week topics were directly related, but I personally enjoyed exploring a variety of topics, and there was really something for everyone. Plus, if there is something you are interested in that is in this area but not on the syllabus, I'm sure Carla would make an effort to incorporate that interest. I was unsure about the Live-Tweeting and blogging in the class at first, as someone who had done neither before the course. But it was fun trying something new, and by the end of the course, I saw how useful these and other tools (Zotero, Diigo) could be.
Carla Martin is one of my favorite professors at Harvard. She is very enthusiastic about the material, but she is also very open to hear your opinion and have a discussion about it. The course size is quite small, which is great for discussions, but kind of a downer for lectures. Overall, I really enjoyed the class--the material we learned was very eye-opening as well.
