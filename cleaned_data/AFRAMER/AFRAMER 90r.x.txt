This is a great class to take if you want to learn Setswana, and the Tswana people.
It is a really good class.
It's a class for people who want a throw-away class, who don't want to learn much or take up a lot of time, and happen to have an interest in Botswana.
This class will be good for you if you are an independent learner. Ntuli is lovely, but don't be afraid to ask questions in class. If you are unclear on something, you might have to work to figure it out, but she will help you. Make sure you really, really stay on top of the material as it is easy to let time go by without truly learning it if you don't put in time outside class.
Spend plenty of time continuously reinforcing the material taught throughout the course to best be able to master the language.
Setswana was a lot of fun and Ntuli is a wonderful teacher. I learned a lot of vocabulary words and really enjoyed the theatre night project. Definitely take it if you need a slightly less intense language class.
I would recommend taking the class if you are looking to learn another language with little stress or difficulty.
This is a great class, take it and Ntuli is amazing as always!
Setswana is a really cool language- the language is also very well taught and fun.
If you want to learn how to speak, write and read in Setswana, this class will give you the fundamentals in a way that works through the language by reading monologues, dialogues, texts and grammar points. It is very resourceful.
Setswana is a great language to learn, the culture surrounding the language is also super interesting. So definitely take this language course
