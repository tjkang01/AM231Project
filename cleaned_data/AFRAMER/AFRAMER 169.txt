INCREDIBLE experience with an INCREDIBLE professor. Professor Blier generates so much enthusiasm for African art and the museum world. It was definitely the most fun course I have taken at Harvard. Readings were great, assignments were great.
Blier is an incredible professor, the woozy structure of the class is worth getting to know her.
