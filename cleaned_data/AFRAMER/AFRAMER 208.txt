Great overview of anthropological theory governed over by typical Comaroffian brilliance/zeal. All contributions welcome.
Always come to class prepared, outline the readings in notebooks, and understand main arguments!
Your professors are invested in sharing their knowledge of social theory, they throw in fun background about many of the anthropologists we read (many of whom they know personally!), and they are a genuine pleasure to listen to.
Take this course for the opportunity to be a student under the Comaroffs; they lead their class on a stimulating intellectual adventure through an important syllabus. Dedicate your time to the readings--digesting and slowly articulating your own take-aways--and allow for time to reflect on John and Jean's brilliant and fast-paced lectures. It is all part of the learning process!
Any class taught by Jean and John Comaroff is an amazing academic experience. This course provides a thorough look at the history of theory emerging from the Global South.  It also creates a strong anthropological foundation for students interested in the discipline. The professors are extremely helpful and do an amazing job explaining concepts during class discussion.
Once in a while, you take a course that challenges you to shift your conceptual frameworks and look at isues from a different view. This is one such transformative course. It is intellectually rigorous and challenging, at the same time as it is engaging and exciting. I would strongly recommend this course to anyone - be they an anthropologist, a political scientist, or a divinity school student - because everyone will find something in the genealogies of knowledge examined in this course to challenge them.
