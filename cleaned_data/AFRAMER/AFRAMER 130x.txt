A wonderful course with two of Harvard's greatest professors. You don't have to (and you won't) love everything by Wright to love this course.
Another great Af-Am class that looks in-depth at one author. Giving great insight into that persons works and influence
Not only is Wright an amazing writer, but this class really allows you to understand Wright's philosophy and writing style by exposing you to his entire collection of work. Not many other courses at Harvard provide the opportunity to delve so deeply into a single artist's work. After taking this class, you will have a notion of Wright unlike many other readers, acclaimed critics included, who have only encountered some of his creations. That being said, you will be reading at least one piece by Wright every single week, which can get intense, given Wright's strong political opinions and complex thought processes. The professors are also really great. Take advantage!
