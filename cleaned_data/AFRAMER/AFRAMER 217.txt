Don't give up an opportunity to study with Elkins as long as you are prepared to work hard and speak with confidence!
excellent overview of colonial african history (not so much post-colonial african history) with a professor who will really push you to know the material and formulate your own positions. despite a heavy leaning toward structural concerns in the beginning, the course overall has a nice balance for people of all theoretical leanings. take the course. be prepared to debate (not just discuss), though.
This is an excellent class for graduate students intending to include a field related to Southern and Eastern African colonial history for their general exams. The focus is on themes, rather than a more general historical review, however. The reading load is not light, but big questions and trends in theory are more the focus of discussions, rather than a detailed analysis of the texts.
Prof. Elkins is amazing! She is caring, insightful and a great discussion leader. She pushes to think outside of your comfort zone and ask and address the key questions in the field. That being said, the course had an English-speaking Africa bias and was too theoretic and methodological.
