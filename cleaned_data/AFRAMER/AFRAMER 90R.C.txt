Cape Verdean Creole was a useful and interesting class. At times the course was somewhat disorganized, but excursions to Dorchester and lessons about the Cape Verdean community here in Boston are excellent.
This is the best class ever. Ines is amazing and I learned so much about Cape Verdean language and culture. I hope to continue learning Cape Verdean Creole with Ines if my schedule permits!
Everyone should take a class in the African language department before they graduate!
This is a wonderful class. Nezi is a wonderful and really accommodating instructor! She makes sure that all her students understand the material before moving on to the next topic. The course also involves field trips where you get to learn more about Cape Verdean culture hands on and eat amazing Cape Verdean food! If you want to learn a new language in a stree-free environment, I highly recommend this course.
The exposure to culture and linguistics related to Cape Verde was unmatched and the support I received from my instructor was amazing.
This is a fun, engaging, and interesting course. Its not difficult, and you get to go on field trips and learn more about the large Cape Verdean diaspora thats in Massachusetts.
