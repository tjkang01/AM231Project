Judith is very enthusiastic and patient with students. This class is a breath of fresh air and a pure joy to take. Take this if you want to learn another language or need to fulfill a language requirement!
This is a great class. Judith is really willing to meet you where you are in the language. She will come early or stay late to help you. She will change the course so that it is most effective to teach everyone. She will go over things again and again just to make sure we all understand. It is really a fun class to go to and I look forward to our meetings!
