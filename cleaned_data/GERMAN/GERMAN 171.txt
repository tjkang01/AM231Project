If you would like the opportunity to discuss important German texts and films in an intimate and friendly setting, this is the right class for you!
One of my favorite classes at Harvard. Professor Hckmann is phenomenal and truly cares about her students (sorry that you won't have her!!).
Dania is a great and engaging professor! Class was never boring and I always looked forward to the discussions. Also, the readings, movies, and art pieces for the course were never dull.
