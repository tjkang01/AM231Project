The course offers a unique opportunity to read nearly all of an author's works in one semester, and Professor Ryan's ongoing research and writing on Sebald make her a great person to have leading the seminar.
This class is a wonderful way to read great, meaningful books and actually take the time to analyse and understand them. If there is any German author worth creating a course around, W. G. Sebald is definitely the right one to pick.
Take this course even if you don't know who W.G. Sebald was. You will soon find out, and in the meantime, you'll learn more about German literary history than you might have expected.
Excellent subject taught by an expert.
