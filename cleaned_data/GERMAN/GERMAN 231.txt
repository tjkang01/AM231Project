You will never forget some of the texts you read - I actually had a nightmare about one of the characters and became the very subject of the painting "der Nachtmahr" on the syllabus.
It was a fascinating course, but a lot of work! Nicole will help you through it though!
Great choice of texts, interesting subdivision of topics, detailed feedback, enthusiastic teaching, not ridiculously difficult (if that is a good thing, you must decide for yourselves).
