This is a cool and interesting class -- Professor Kirakosian is great -- but do NOT take it if you are not interested in a time-intensive performance process at the end of the semester.
The readings were interesting, but the class discussion was somewhat lacking, since lots of people were coming from different academic backgrounds and were not familiar with studying (medieval) literature.The performance was a disaster, utterly not enjoyable, and very time-consuming, especially during reading period, which is when the bulk of the rehearsals are scheduled. Regardless of what else you have going on for other courses, you will be expected to show up at every rehearsal, and they all last for hours because they are so disorganized and the professor pauses at the end of every line to give feedback.
This was a fun class and allowed me to learn something about a topic I knew nothing about!
