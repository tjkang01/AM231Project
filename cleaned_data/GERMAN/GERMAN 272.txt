White history of hermeneutics
This course offers a unique way into the history of theology and philosophy. Since the syllabus is modeled on Professor Hamilton's book project, it gives students an opportunity to see where his research is leading him. Professor Hamilton gives some of the best lectures at Harvard.
If you are drawn to abstract questions of how interpretation occurs--and how different types of interpretive has been theorized over the past several thousand years, then absolutely take this course. The material is admittedly challenging, but only because you are reading some of the foremost thinkers of the Western tradition--unified around a set of key questions that Hamilton uses perfectly to structure the course, while simultaneously allowing the texts to breathe on their own terms. By the end you will have received a remarkably comprehensive survey of the material (check the syllabus to see if these are the thinkers you want!) Hamilton is a brilliant scholar and almost overwhelming erudite in that he can summon an etymological and philosophical heritage of any concept you bring to the table. This makes him a gifted seminar leader--able to provide an initial framework and then draw together disparate points from participants into a unified whole. I learned an unbelievably amount from this course--all my recommendations!
