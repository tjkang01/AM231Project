It is a very difficult course.  But it provides a great foundation for anybody who is seriously interested in interdisciplinary work or in cultural studies.
A good introduction to theories or "turns" that you are expected to know in upper-level humanities seminars.
Take this course.  I enjoyed it immensely, and it has fundamentally influenced the ways in which I think about culture and literature.  Also, although this course involves sophisticated material and discussion, it is not difficult, because its few assignments do not get in the way of the reading and thinking that are essential to the course.
