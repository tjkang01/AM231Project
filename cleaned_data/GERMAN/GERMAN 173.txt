Ryan is incredible. She is engaging, very interested in the material, and keeps the seminar class going no matter what. The combination of interesting discussions in addition to short lectures on insightful background information was just lovely.
I think a future student should just be prepared for a great journey that will make sparks fly.
I truly enjoyed this class and the readings are well chosen, though there is quite a bit of it.  Nonetheless, none of the readings were dry or boring historical texts - I enjoyed all of them, novels/short stories/background texts and all.  Professor Ryan does a great job integrating German literature and history.  Note that there is a section once a week in addition to lecture, which the course description doesn't indicate.  However, the sections ended up being quite useful in that we did close readings, and there was a German section, which was useful for practicing German.
Great variety of texrts, a fascinating and little-know subject and Professor Ryan is a superb teacher
The course is one of those rare gems that come up occasionally. Bored with the panoply of Goethe/Kant/Schiller courses? Finally - German colonialism. Likely the coolest subject matter of the entire German department offerings this year. The once-a-week lecture was not difficult and was thought provoking. Section was a nice way to focus on the German reading and was not demanding at all. Papers were fairly graded. No surprises, you reap what you sow. Most literature is very interesting and readable (there's Kafka!) with only collect few bores from the 1800's.
