This is a great course to delve deep into the Frankfurt School. If you want to dig deep into some key texts that still today are talked about, this is your chance.
Discussions were incredibly thought-provoking and inspired ideas for future work. I am happy to have been able to participate in this seminar.
Rick makes even the cranky German Adorno come to life with his enthusiasm and expertise regarding the Frankfurt School.
Professor Rentschler is a very sharp thinker and critic. The selection of readings follows a clear agenda which is further developed during the discussion. The application of theory to film is enforced very successfully.
