The best class I've taken at Harvard.  The material is difficult, but the way the class is structured and Professor Hueckmann make it worth it.  Through this class you gain a pretty awesome understanding of German culture and literature, and your language skills will improve exponentially.
Overall a fantastic class. Dania is fantastic, the assignments are challenging but worthwhile, and you will really see yourself grow as a German reader and writer.
If you're interested in German literature or want to improve your German, definitely take this class.
