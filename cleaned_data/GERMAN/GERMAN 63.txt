Be prepared to work on your writing.
Good class overall, readings and assigned material can be a bit archaic, but it's chill otherwise and Dania is really nice.
Excellent class. The readings are so interesting, workload is very manageable and you learn a lot about yourself and the world.
This class is absolutely fantastic! You hardly realize the 1.5 hours pass by as you discuss incredibly interesting and important issues. Your ability to speak and understand German improves a ton.
Dania was incredible! This class was always full of lively discussions and we learned a lot--not just German but also about the German history, the complicated cultural aspects, and above all, home, exile and emigration.
