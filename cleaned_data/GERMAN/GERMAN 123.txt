It's more specific than the broader German literature survey courses, but if you're interested in drama, this is a great place to delve into it.
Because it is basically a survey, the class helps you get a good understanding of the history of german drama, but you also do close-readings and really engage with each text.
Your comprehension of literary and academic German should genuinely be at the college level, or you will spend quite a bit of time looking up words or fudging, particularly with Kleist and Nietzsche. Also, the more practice you have articulating opinions in an academic setting in German, the better. I am talking about simple formulations, such as "I contend that..."; "There are many parallels between the two, such as ...." etc.
Very good overview of crucial works of German drama, taught with great enthusiasm.
