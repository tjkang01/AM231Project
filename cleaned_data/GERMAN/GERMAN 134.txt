I thoroughly enjoyed Understanding Beethoven. Professors Gordon and Rehding are amazing at leading the seminar, and Etha was very helpful in providing comments on the assignments and writings. While this course is about Beethoven, I learned so much about music and philosophy. If you love Beethoven, or classical music in general,  you should definitely take this course.
This class is one more than just about Beethoven.  Some really important debates, even ones still occurring today, uses Beethoven to really explore such themes (i.e. feminism, terrorism, Nazi regime, cold war, philosophy, performance-based methodology, etc.).
