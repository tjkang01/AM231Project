Take this if you are interested in learning about the crossover between literature and psychoanalysis and if you want a very strong introduction to Lacan, Bataille, Barthes, Deleuze, Cixous, and Kristeva and how they function with complementary literary texts.
Very rewarding if you put in the effort and ask questions. The class requires time and actual critical thought though.
An amazing collection of intellectuals and their ideas, so well put together, that really concerns all of us, no matter the concentration
This is a great course to take for a high-level, quite in-depth discussion of really abstract psychoanalytic concepts. It would be good to take as an introduction, but I think is a lot better if you already have some pre-established interests or ideas in the realm of theory that you can work with over the semester.
Professor Simons is a great asset to the course, as he has literally written a (the?) book about these people. Also, a primer on structuralism/literary theory in general will make the difference of night and day for this course. (I personally found "Structuralism and Semiotics" by Terence Hawkes to be eye-opening.)
This class reworked the way in which I think about reading.
