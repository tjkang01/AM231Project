This course is a very interesting one and a perfect fit with respect to preparation for the generals but if you enjoy classes where you are encouraged to develop own thoughts and think outside the box this class might not be the best choice. That's the reason why I would recommend this course with reservations.
The course provides a great introduction into Hoffmann's texts and the Romantic thought. Discussion and application of theory turn out too short.
If you are interested in theory and in getting to know a great instructor, this is the course for you!
