Take this course to gain confidence about academic/formal Russian presentation and writing skills, but don't expect to be anything less than bored senseless along the way.
Unless this class changes radically, it is not going to teach anyone how to actively use academic Russian. It is a waste of time. This is unfortunate, because Veronika is a great instructor. Yet, the way the course is designed right now, it does not offer anything constructive.
