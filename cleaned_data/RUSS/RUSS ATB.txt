Using authentic texts fosters a unique language learning opportunity.  It enables you to understand complex concepts much more quickly than a normal language class.  If you want to study foreign literature, this is excellent preparation.  If you only want the language study, it is nonetheless helpful to introduce you to both the language and culture.
This is a class that will require dedication, as with any language course, but stick with it, and you will see results in no time. It may appear frustrating and a lot in the beginning, but it is worth the time and dedication.
This is an excellent class! Oksana is an amazing teacher and will get you reading, writing, and speaking Russian faster than you believed was possible. Learning through reading Pushkin does not put you behind with listening or speaking skills at all, and it is very fulfilling to be able to translate authentic Russian texts by the end of the year. As long as you do some work every day, the homework is manageable and always actually helps you learn the language.
