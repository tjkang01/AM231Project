Good luck!
A great survey of the literature on authoritarianism, democracy and democratization.  Highly recommended!
This has been one of my favorite classes so far. Prof. Levitsky is amazing, the discussions are really lively, and you learn a ton. Just be aware that there is a lot of reading.
One of the best courses the graduate program in Government has to offer, taught by professors doing really interesting and creative research on the topic.  Great forum for discussing strengths and weaknesses in the democratization literature, as well as for floating your own twists on these ideas and getting a cross-continental, cross-time perspective of the process.
This was the best course I've ever taken - engaging readings, excellent and enthusiastic teaching, interesting and high-level discussions in class. Take it if at all possible.
This class is great!  The content is fascinating and Levitsky and Ziblatt are both really good professors.
It's more reading than I realized, so plan accordingly.
This class was probably the best graduate seminar I've taken at Harvard or elsewhere.
It's worth taking this class just to be in a seminar with Professors Ziblatt and Levitsky. They're great!
This is one of the better seminars I have been in.  Good class discussion, instructors are engaging.  Lots of work, but interesting and helpful.
