Every student of political theory, whether undergraduate or graduate, ought to take any class Richard Tuck offers. While he is unlikely to return to Rousseau for some years, this class was a wonderful combination of professorial wisdomProf Tuck's knowledge of the history of Western political thought is unmatched, even at Harvardand high-level discussion. The large number of older PhD students greatly enhanced the level of discussion.
I would recommend this course to anyone interested in gaining a more comprehensive understanding of Rousseau's life and work than most courses offer. The chance to work with experienced and knowledgeable fellow students was valuable. The professor crafted an inclusive atmosphere that made students feel welcome and comfortable contributing to discussion.
