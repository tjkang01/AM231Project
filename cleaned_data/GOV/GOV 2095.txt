This course will allow students to see where the rubber meets the road in theory and practice. The most fertile and complicated aspect of theoretical analysis is understanding when to apply it and how it can be done. Knowledge of such mandates an understanding of the role quantitative data plays in theory.
This class should be a requirement for political theorists. The axes of conflict it lays out about the discipline are clear and coherent, and the questions that can be mined from these ruptures are plentiful and profound.
You need to be serious about political theory, I mean really serious.
