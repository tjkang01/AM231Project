Every comparative politics student who is on campus after G2 year can benefit from this course--it really helps you learn to think like a political scientist.
This is, to my knowledge, the best place to get feedback from a broad set of voices on work-in-progress within the government department.  A strong reciprocity norm helps create a constructive climate for discussing how projects can be improved.
Always come to class!  Take this class every semester you're here after generals.  Expose your ideas here as much as possible.
This is an excellent class to get peer feedback, and to get feedback from two very knowledgeable, very tactful and supportive professors.
This is a great class, though by its nature its character and quality will depend on who is teaching it and who is enrolled year-to-year.
