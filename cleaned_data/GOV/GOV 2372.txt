There is a lot of reading and many topics covered in the course, but it provides an awesome foundation for any exploration of group dynamics within politics.  In particular, this course would be incredibly useful for anyone interested in race and ethnic politics or social policy.
It is one of the best courses I've taken
This is an excellent course to take if you are interested in political behavior. It exposes you to a whole subset of literature that you would probably not come across otherwise, unless you are explicitly interested in political psychology.
