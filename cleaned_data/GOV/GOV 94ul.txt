This was a good, small seminar to discuss issues about the role of scientific expertise in the democratic system. It was much more philosophically and theory oriented than I expected, with not as much discussion about policy. However, it was still fascinating. If you're interested in both democratic theory and the role science plays in democracy, this would be a good seminar to take.
This a relaxed class with some interesting material. If you're coming to it from a hard science background, however, you'll likely find a lot of the reading annoying, in the sense that it seems to misunderstand science. There is very little on the reading list actually authored by a scientist, and some that is only indirectly related to the governance of science. Nonetheless, for those interested in the governance of science, this class is a relatively painless way to become acquainted with this body of literature. Also there is a lot of freedom on the final paper, which makes it (potentially) quite fun.
Landauer is great and very nice. This isn't an easy class by any means - you will leave section scratching your head wondering what you just talked about for two hours. But a really interesting and broad subject that gives you the freedom to pursue a gamut of ideas for your final project.
