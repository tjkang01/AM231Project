A great strength of this course sequence is that it sets its students up to undertake an extended research project related to inequality and social policy. Students receive lots of feedback on that project at every stage of the process.
The class will be different from year to year depending on who the professors are. It's a required course for Inequality fellows.
It is a decent course but can be difficult to find your spot in.
Best aspect of being in ISP
a lot of work, not always targeted, but very enlightening on topics of inequality
Great class for those interested in how research relates to policy.
This class is an outstanding opportunity to engage with expert professors and exciting student-colleagues on questions of urgent political, social, and academic interest.
That the experience taking the course is only half professors and materials. For me, some of the best parts about the class were the dialogues with individuals in other disciplines and an opportunity to learn how other disciplines see the world. We are very fortunate to have an engaging, curious cohort that contributed to a wonderful class experience.
It becomes impossible to keep up with every word of all readings - don't worry, and focus on key points!
