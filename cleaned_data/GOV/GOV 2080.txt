An extremely interesting course from one of the world's best Machiavelli scholars. Whatever your ideological persuasion, taking a course with Professor Mansfield is a worth experience.
The course is well organized around its central (and very important) theme, but there are times when a more thorough discussion of the issues will be passed by.
It is really worth having a small graduate seminar class with Professor Mansfield, who has many interesting insights into the range of political philosophers covered.
One gets the sense that Professor Mansfield's cryptic comments like "The feminists claim that human beings don't have essences" are invitations to thymotic speech rather than intended seriously.  That being said, for whatever reason, the seminar was unfortunately lacking in heated, passionate debate.  Perhaps this is because participants were in earnest, lemming-like agreement with Professor Mansfield's sardonic asides.  Feminists: be warned.
This class requires a lot of reading and time so be prepared.
Prof. Mansfield is a great teacher, and the opportunity to explore a great work of philosophy in detail under his tutelage is not to be missed.
I don't know how similar this course is to Professor Mansfield's other seminars, but it was a wonderful opportunity to engage deeply with a single (albeit VERY long text) with an incredibly knowledgeable professor. That said, it does NOT work like most other seminars; it's more of a small-group lecture than a typical seminar, and it's important to keep that in mind.
