A good basic grounding in the basics of quantitative social science, but not always incredibly well run. If you want to do a somewhat quant gov/social studies thesis however, you should take this.
If you are thinking about writing a quantitative thesis for gov, take this class! It will teach you methods that you need to know and give you a head start in thinking about a question and a design for your thesis.
Be ready for stata
This course teaches very valuable analytical skills that would be extremely useful if you are considering writing a thesis. But even if you are not considering writing a thesis, I would still recommend this course as knowing Stata is definitely a good skill to have.
If Chiara is still teaching this class, and you want to improve your quantitative skills, you should definitely take it! Chiara is so knowledgeable and answers every question clearly and patiently, and is willing to spend a lot of time to help you with your paper. I'm really grateful for her feedback, as it was so useful in helping me write my paper!!
Great class, you'll learn a lot! Chiara is the best!
