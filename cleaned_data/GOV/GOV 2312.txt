Overall a good class with a neat opportunity to get questions into well-done, nationally representative polls.
This course is fantastic! Ansolabehere and Penn are awesome professors, and it was really fun to get to write and analyze polls with them. I learned more applicable skills in this class than in pretty much any other class at Harvard.
