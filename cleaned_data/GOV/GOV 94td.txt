George is a fantastic seminar leader; he provides great summaries of the readings and major ideas, but leaves plenty of time for discussion. The readings can be a lot, but are really interesting and definitely worth the time.
The course is incredibly rewarding. You get the chance to learn a lot about something that really matters in this world. However, do know that it is a lot of time and work. If you are willing to put in the hours, you may leave this class inspired by some topic of democratic consolidation that could inspire further research and devotion.
This is a great seminar! It will really push and challenge you to defend your views on Western liberal democracy. Make sure you do ALL The readings and watch ALL the videos. George is a really engaging and supportive teacher.
This is one of the most difficult classes in the government department, in my experience at least, but also the most instructive.
Take it only if you are interested in the subject matter.
This is a great class, and you'll get a lot out of it if you do the reading. It's one of those classes that makes you more well-rounded and capable of having political conversations.
