Great professor and Great tf, just beware that the material is very dry and gets a little complicated.
Understanding the readings is a lot of work, but you will know a lot more about political economy by the end.
This course will give you a much better understanding of important points of country organization, welfare states, globalization, and a wide variety of topics that will help in other courses. Readings can be difficult but are definitely manageable and incredibly rewarding when they are understood.
The readings are great, as is Prof Iversen.
This is the class to take if you want to have an intelligent discussion on where developed countries will go and should go given the challenges of the 21st century. Be prepared to work hard, but the reading is absolutely crucial.
that it is a difficult class that you need to put time into, but that it is absolutely worth it! this is one of the best classes i have taken so far at harvard.
This course is a wonderful introduction to political economy, taught by a highly enthusiastic and dynamic professor. The course is excellent!
The class is very interesting and touches on many cool puzzles in political economics.
