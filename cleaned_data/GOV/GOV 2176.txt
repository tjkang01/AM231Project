This is a great class - in terms of fruitful discussions, it is the best class I have taken at Harvard so far. Professor Hall and Professor Thelen are great teachers with a tremendous amount of knowledge. The range of materials discussed over the course of the semester is broad, but it all comes together very nicely. I would definitely recommend this class!
Definitely take this course. Professors are wonderful and the readings are great.
Peter Hall and Kathleen Thelen are exquisite and it is a privilege to spend time discussing political economy with and being taken seriously. Wonderful experience.
This course offers a great overview of different social science approaches to understanding the structure of capitalism and inequality across time and space. The reading and writing for the course is demanding and requires a significant amount of time and effort. But if you engage in the course seriously you are likely to get a lot out of the readings and class discussions. The course also offers critical engagements with some of the most important and interesting questions of our time, including the past and future of the welfare state, the causes of increasing inequality, and the relationship between capitalism and democracy.
Peter and Kathy are just great!
If you are interested in inequality, take this class.  Although it is primarily a political economy course, our discussions were broad enough to include sociological and philosophical topics.
