Great class for learning about how space can influence a myriad of behaviors.  Good to learn the tools to deal with that!
great way to learn how use mapping in research.
Great readings, very useful skill-building exercises, great professor
This is a very broad swath of geographic analysis, so in order to complete your project, you will want to delve much deeper into one topic or another, and it would be best if you could do that earlier rather than later.
A great course if you have the quantitative and government background. Experience mapping is a big plus.
This is great course. You can tell that Ryan really cares about teaching. He's always very helpful and gives great feedback.  The readings were generally pretty interesting as well and I appreciated the handful of spatial methods sections Ryan organized for us.
