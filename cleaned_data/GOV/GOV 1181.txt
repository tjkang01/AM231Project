This is a fine gov class. It's on a topic that most people don't know about though a lot of people may pretend otherwise. It was not exciting or mind-blowing but it was never painful or unfair. There was only one mandatory reading per lecture so it's easy to keep up with the material. Papers will require outside research or reading the optional readings, but this is totally doable since they gave 2 weeks for short/medium length papers. Take it, it's not risky and its on material that is pretty relevant to current affairs.
This class is very interesting and will give you a general understanding of the European Union at a fundamental level, but you must engage fully with the readings to completely benefit from this class.
European politics is increasing significantly in importance, especially with the recent Euro and Ukraine crises, and this is the class to take to further your knowledge in the subject
The course is a farce and I feel bad because Prof. Genschel cares a lot and is well-intentioned, but he's clearly new to the U.S., so I can't entirely fault him. The assignments are easy and the grading was generous, but I'm not quite sure what I walked away with.
Good class - learn a good deal relatively painlessly. Ermal is the best!
This is the worst class I've taken. It was clear that the professor and TF just completely gave up on it. The professor told us on the last day that he felt bad for us that we had to take this class.
This course is great for students interested specifically in the logistics and history of the European Union. 1181 is a superb introductory course if you have any interest in the intricacies of the EU. It also challenges you to think critically about the future role of the EU.  Lectures are very helpful and informative even though they are an hour and a half long.
This class was excellent. Minimal work but huge impact. Take this if you are interested in politics or IR and if you have the option to.
