Bates changed the grading from 50% section discussion 25% paper and 25% final to 20-40-40% literally 10 days before the exam. I took the course because it is the only Gov94 that allows you to have the paper count for 25%. Before you take it for this exact reason, double check with Bates.This is mostly a History + Economics course. If you like Economics and have taken Ec10b, this will be easier for you. Remember to take a lot of notes during section because there is no online material except the readings. Talk with Bates about your essay. He is quite hard to get a hold of, because he didnt even give us his email so make a lot of efforts.
Interesting class and Bates really knows his information. This is a class that is pretty stress free until May when everything collapses into a paper and exam and you find yourself scrambling because you have no clue as to what can be asked of you.
Class has a lot of economics so it may be helpful to have a strong background there. Discussion is more interesting than the readings. Very back-loaded course, literally nothing until the final paper and the final
This course is incredibly informative and rewarding. As somebody who took it with absolutely no background in Africa, I learned a ton.
Complete the readings; otherwise, you'll walk away without having learned much. Overall, the course offers an economical/historical approach to understanding state success and failure in Sub-Saharan Africa.
