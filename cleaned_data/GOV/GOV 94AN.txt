If you're a Government concentrator you NEED to take this course or courses like it. They're such a rad opportunity to focus on subjects outside of whatever's trendy and gonna get you a job in the state department, to learn about how policies actually affect real people, and the people who are generally excluded from rarified places of privilege like Harvard. Very chill course and just a great opportunity to get some foundational knowledge on a lot of important topics.
Overall, this is a really important and effective course. The readings are wonderful, and Professor Tivig is clearly passionate about the course and communicates the importance of the issues it covers well. I feel like I am walking away from this course with a much better understanding about the margins and how interconnected various marginalized groups can be.
This is a great course. It really focuses on big social issues this country faces.
Excellent, thought provoking material. Andrea is a great lecturer and discussion leader. The material is engaging and interesting week after week.
Like other 94 classes, this class doesn't require any work until your midterm paper and final paper, both of which are fairly long but you are given more than enough time to complete it. The conversation is fantastic especially if you're interested in the subject matter, and while a 2 hour discussion sometimes gets long (especially if you have many other classes that day) ultimately the course is one of the best you could hope to take.
A very worthwhile course. Will change the way you view certain social issues in America.
