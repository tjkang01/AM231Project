The class does not give much assistance as designed to designing research projects, nor did regional students seem satisfied with the lack of regional specificity.  Comparative government students will be the most satisfied with this course.
Since I didn't find class discussions very rewarding, one is probably better off doing the reading on one's own.
The readings are very interesting to people who are interested in Eastern Europe. Professors are very helpful.
This course is a must if you are interested in the politics of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
The class is a lot of reading, but also very rewarding. Make sure that you are committed to the subject matter before enrolling.
The course is a pretty standard graduate seminar format that requires several hours of reading per week as well as a major research paper. It is particularly valuable for those going into academia, but policy-oriented students can get equally as much out of the course. Both professors are great to work with, and it's helpful getting both of their teaching styles and view points since they alternate on a weekly basis.
Great class if you are interested in deepening your knowledge on the region and writing a research paper on a topic of your choice.
Great overview of theoretical debates and important themes in post-socialist transitions. It was a treat to receive feedback from and hear the perspectives of both professors who are extremely knowledgable in their fields.
