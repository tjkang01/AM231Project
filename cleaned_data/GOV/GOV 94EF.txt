I would strongly recommend this course to anyone who has even a remote interest in race politics and wants to expand their knowledge on a critical moment in U.S. government. I especially encourage this course for anyone interested in writing a senior thesis on the topic or on any topic related to race politics.
Take this class! Professor Gay is one of the best teachers I've had at Harvard, the reading list is fascinating and well constructed, and the discussions exciting and thought provoking. I left this course with a much better understanding of the subject area and, I think, a better understanding of how political science works as a discipline. The workload is quite reasonable - a healthy reading load each week and a research paper written over the course of the semester.
This class gives a great account of where Black politics are in the U.S. today and it teaches you valuable research skills.  However, it is a definitely a class where you need to be on top of your reading and ready to talk so be preferred to make the class a priority.
This class is a good amount of work, but it's well worth it. Claudine Gay is a more than capable professor who will challenge you to think outside the box.
Hard work, no games but entirely worth it. By far my most rewarding class of the semester.
