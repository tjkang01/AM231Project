This class is a great introduction to making, sustaining, and defending arguments. It is an introduction that is about the 'doing' of political theory rather than the knowing of what thinker thought what.
This is a very good option for a grad-level contemporary political theory class. The readings are great and the class covers many really interesting and important issues.
An interesting complement to traditional courses on texts and thinkers, especially if you've already taken the traditional courses.
This is an interactive class with a setting that is unique in that it is both very refined and very inviting.  Arthur is truly a gentleman and a scholar.  He also has a well developed sense of humor.
Wonderful class! Arthur is a great teacher. Best way to dip your toe into political theory pool if you haven't been there before.
A great course to clarify one's thinking about politics and the concepts embedded in comparative politics. Useful for any and all graduate students in the Government Department, the PEG program, or the Public Policy program.
Even if you are a non-theorist, this course will help you think about political science in any subfield.
This is the perfect overview to become acquainted with political theory.
That this is an exceptional way to get an overview of and learn about many strands of political theory.
Excellent course. Recommended for all graduate students in the department, with or without a background in political theory.
