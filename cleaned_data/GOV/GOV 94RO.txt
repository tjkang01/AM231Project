Professor Rogowski may not be the most eloquent of professors, but his depth of knowledge of the subject matter and his passion to help his students succeed is second to none. If you are not someone who has that passion to learn about our political system, then this isn't the class for you. If you do have that passion, prepare yourself for lively discussion and a dynamic class environment.
This class was an amazing in-depth look at the presidency and the separation of powers, and if that is something you are even remotely interested in, and you have the time, you should most definitely take it.
If you want to learn a great deal about the American presidency, especially with the recent rise of populism, look no further than taking this seminar with Professor Rogowski. The readings are not too much, there is sufficient time to prepare for your presentation and paper, and the professor allows for new class topics apart from those on the syllabus to be introduced with the development of news and student suggestions. The class also has no textbook or additional costs which is always a plus.
Very interesting course, thoughtful discussion
