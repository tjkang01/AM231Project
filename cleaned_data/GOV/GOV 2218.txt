An good option if you want to be immersed in post-Soviet Russian high politics.
Take this course if you're studying Russian politics.
I highly recommend this class for those interested in Russia and willing to tackle a wide array of readings with one of the region's top scholars.
I would strongly recommend this course if you have a solid background in Russian history and at least some knowledge of general political science.  A great course if Russian politics sincerely interests you already, not so much if you are dabbling in Russia or politics.
A very good course for anyone who wants to gain in-depth knowledge of Russian politics.
