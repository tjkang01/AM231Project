Take the class if you really want to engage different elements of academics into one specific field of academia. John's really smart and he knows his stuff.
This was an incredible class--I learned so much, and I would recommend it to anyone who is curious about North Korea and looking to engage in substantive research.
This is a fantastic class with an amazing professor.  I highly recommend taking it.
This was the most interesting class I have taken at Harvard, both because the subject matter is so foreign, but also because it taught me a new way to think and write. You really feel like if you can study something as difficult as North Korea that you can do anything.
If you are interested in North Korea, this is one of the few classes that goes into depth about the political happenings and international negotiation issues. There is a special focus on North Korean relations with China, so this is a perfect course if you are interested in international relations overall in East Asia.
A very interesting course for people interested in an "intro" to North Korea. Be prepared to participate in rigorous discussion, though discussion did not occur as often as I would like. You can get a lot out of the course if you do the readings and engage the professor - he is very knowledgeable and on the cutting edge of North Korea-watching.
