Great environment, I learned a lot. The course challenged my idea of what citizenship means.
Great course that focuses on both the legal and social sides of citizenship and immigration policy in Western nations. Colin is organized and engaging
Although the course was not quite what I was expecting, I enjoyed the class.  I thought it was going to be focussed on the current immigration debate, but it instead focussed on the normative idea of citizenship.  It wasn't the most riveting class, but it provided me with a really thorough understanding of citizenship and immigration.  This knowledge is very timely.  Colin cared a lot about the class and did everything he could to make it a great experience.
