Definitely take this course if you want to be able to either (1) do experimental work in a methodologically rigorous way and (2) understand the work of other political scientists.  Given the very broad interest in experiments in the discipline, this is clearly an avenue that any serious political science student should want to go down.
This course was the most useful course of my first year. If you are planning on conducting an experiment, this course is obviously valuable. The course also helps develop clear thinking about causality. Last, I find the experimental framework a helpful one when thinking about non-experimental work. Developing the ability to think experimentally is in and of itself a valuable end.
Great class if you are committed to running a pilot survey experiment (or larger)
The class is a useful exposure to an important methodology in political science, with the ability to actually run an experiment.
