The topics that the course covers are interesting but due to the rather unstructured nature of the course, it seems as though to really delve into them would require much more time than we realistically have as graduate students (considering this course is not particularly related to our research). As such, treatment of many topics was superficial and more problematically - jumped around a lot so that it was hard to follow at times.
Great for fulfilling theory requirement
Take a theory course on theory for its own sake, like 1061. You won't learn theory here, you'll just learn how to have futile arguments with theorists. Rather than awkwardly forcing disciplines together, just learn theory as theory. Its interesting, worthwhile, and enjoyable on its own, without any reference to political science.
