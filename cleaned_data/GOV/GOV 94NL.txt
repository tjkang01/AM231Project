Content is pretty interesting, course is pretty disorganised.
Professor Harrison is amazing and is willing to adapt the course to be most useful to individual students, depending on their backgrounds and their purposes for taking the course.
Interesting class on a number of polling and public opinion topics.  A lot of discussion on what is "right" when it comes to polling.
This seminar is a great overview of political survey research from many different angles. Prof. Harrison works very hard to make sure that everyone gets the chance to focus on the topic they're most interested in, not just with the final paper, but also by changing assigned readings, letting students dictate the flow of discussion, and being accessible to talk about any topic.
Professor Harrision is very kind, thoughtful, and helpful; he's a great professor to work with in a small setting and he is very knowledgable and experienced in the course material. He will help you to succeed even if you don't have an adequate background of some of the material, but I would say that in order to get the most out of this class for yourself, take it if you know you have a more comprehensive understanding of statistical analysis beyond an introductory stats course.
Take this course! You will come out of it with skills that will help you in the rest of your social science courses. Professor Harrison is really great, and he really cares about his students. He was always willing to meet with me anytime and when we met he gave me really insightful comments that helped me with my assignments. He is really enthusiastic about this material, and you could feel that throughout the entire semester.
