challenging but rewarding and helpful
This class gives you a sense of a very particular area of political economy research and requires a fair bit of economics background.  I would recommend taking it after several other quantitative or econ classes.
I got A LOT out of it, but really depends on what one wants to achieve and how much one can get passionate about that kind of literature....everyone should be exposed to it the first year of grad school....
The material for this class in interesting if you are interested in redistribution, otherwise you may want to skip it.
An amazing chance to learn about field of political economy with two of its principal architects
Excellent seminar course -- be prepared to participate and have your views challenged by the profs and the other students in the class.
A great opportunity to develop a project and get feedback if you are interested in these topics.
I don't think this will appeal to students outside the Gov Dept.
Good review of the state of the field in political economy and an excellent opportunity to write a research paper with lots of feedback from the professors.
A difficult course but very exciting; shows you how to combine models and with empirical work; draws interesting links between politics and economics in analyzing the welfare state, something no other course in Gov Dept does
