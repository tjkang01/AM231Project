This class is very enjoyable and low-stress. Take it, especially if you are a Gov concentrator and need an elective.
You should definitely take this class if you are interested in the topics. It allowed me to explore my personal areas of interest with guidance and new perspectives from political geography. However, the lectures aren't consistently exciting, and discussion depends quite heavily on whether you've done the reading.
This class provides a really interesting way to look at the impact of geography on politics and vice versa. It has really great readings, which also provide a quick insight into post-structuralist theory. I would recommend you take it, and definitely do the readings! They are not burdensome at all.
This course is amazing. If you want to know a lot about political geography in one semester, then definitely take this course when Dr. Mountz is on campus. There is a great range of topics to go over that are divided appropriately over the semester. Although there are 5 papers to write, if you are really enjoying the course and do your readings, they really do not affect your other work at all.
