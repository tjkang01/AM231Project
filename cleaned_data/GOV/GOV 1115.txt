This is an extremely interesting and enjoyable class. Professor Ekiert has invaluable advice in helping you think about the final paper and you come away with a fairly systematic and comprehensive understanding of one of the major topics in the social sciences. You won't regret taking this class!
Strongly recommend if you're a undergrads interested in contentions politics
I would enthusiastically recommend this course, even to students that are not interested in social movements. The material is excellent, really interesting and Professor Ekiert is excellent. He is a great lecturer, spirited and great to talk to. He helped me choose a topic I was very satisfied with for the final paper and helped me develop an argument in a way I had not seen professors do before. With that said, the course does have intense readings; intense in the regards that they are most appreciated if they are closely read (they therefore necessitate a lot of attention). One must also write a 25 page final paper. The course is certainly challenging but I am very happy that I took the course and challenged myself in this particular way.
