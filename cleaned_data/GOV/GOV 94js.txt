This is a great seminar: Prof. Snyder is a really patient teacher (not just a professor, but a teacher), and met with me whenever I needed help on my research project. The class focused on political platforms, and while the topic sometimes seemed mundane, Prof. Snyder made it interesting, and helped us learn a lot about parties and interest groups in the process.
you'll learn a lot about stata!
This was a great class. I was a little on the fence about taking it, but I'm glad I did. It turned out to not be about political parties and interest groups, but that's okay. I loved that we learned to use Stata, and that Professor Snyder was willing to spend so much time with us.  The subject material was also interesting, and getting to do our own research projects was clearly a much better alternative than what the other seminars were offering.
This class is phenomenal, especially because the class relates to every day life. You also gain skills that you can use in a real life scenario.
Professor Snyder is an exceptionally accessible professor, and you will learn a lot about writing a research paper from him. Do not come into this class, however, expecting to learn much in broad terms about political parties. You really only spend time in class and outside of class working on your own individual project.
