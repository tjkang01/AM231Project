Probably the worst class ever: you learn nothing from the classes nor the Professor, but still manage to get a ridiculously bad grade. Please do yourself a favor an take either a hard class that teaches you something or an easy class that does not arbitrarily grades students instead. Because this is just nonsense.
A very interesting course if you would like to expand your general knowledge of the EU and European politics.
Brutal time (8:45 am), but if you can stomach it the class is pretty chill. really get out as much as you put in; Europe's governance structure is more complicated than people perceive and it takes a while to wrap your head around it. Beneyto is super smart and is a great person to talk to outside of class. Not sure if he will be around next year since he's a visiting professor. Will need to investigate that.
Do the readings, but if you want to be able to meaningfully contribute to class discussion, find some European current events publications and start reading them regularly.
I don't think I would recommend this course. You basically just talk about European politics for the whole semester and everyone just says what he thinks. 50 % of the final grade is your paper. The instructions for the paper were almost not existent. Basically, you are just told to write a policy paper. Grade seemed totally random.
I loved this class and it pushed me to think about current issues critically and deeply. Discussions were engaging and important and the Professor led the class in a soft spoken but intelligent way. I highly recommend taking this class. It has been one of my favorite classes I have taken.
Great Class!!!! Take it if you have any intent in europe
