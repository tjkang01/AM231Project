If your math is rusty and you dont want to take calc 1, calc2, linear algebra sequence with undergrads, the this class is a way to go.
Appropriate for the graduate students who want to understand mathematical principles
It's a great way to prepare for more serious courses in statistics if you don't already have a lot of math under your belt. It's been an excellent experience. Pedram is a very gifted teacher and enthusiastically helps the class take on difficult concepts in not a lot of time.
Pedram is among the best math teachers you're likely ever to encounter. He has the rare ability not only clearly to explain difficult mathematical concepts and the logics behind them, but also to get students genuinely excited about the material.
I think this is the perfect remedial course for graduate students with deficient math backgrounds (which is how I describe myself, not my classmates!). Prof. Safari is incredibly patient, very clear and conceptual in his explanations, which ensures that you get the big picture even if you're not really following all the computations. He focuses on the actual meaning of what we are doing using simple examples rather than making overly complex computations. And it's really designed for graduate students, for whom research does take precedence above all else and who likely can't do dozens of hours of problem sets even if this were their only class (also talking about myself...).
If you would like to learn multi-variable calculus and linear algebra in a collaborative environment with a dedicated professor, take this class! Although we didn't cover topic as in-depth as classes in the math department, I think that all the students got a lot out of the class.
The lectures are excellent. While Pedram may not collect assignments regularly, you will not get enough out of this course if you do not consistently work through the recommended homework.
