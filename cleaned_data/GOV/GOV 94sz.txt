great teacher, really engaging, make sure you do the readings
This is an absolutely awful course. Avoid it at all costs. The professor this year was so arrogant and stuck up it wasn't funny. Never could be wrong, never could accept that maybe there are alternatives to her way of thinking. Cold uncaring professor. Would not recommend if my life depended on it. She needs to go back to the sandpit she crawled out of. No matter your political philosophy she was against you.
The course was interesting and relevant, though not riveting.  Because the professor is visiting, it is unlikely it will be offered again, anyway.
