A lot of reading but the final paper is great for trying out a possible thesis topic. Professor Simons is very accessible
Definitely keep up with the readings. Although specific readings were not always addressed during class, the first paper is very much dependent on familiarity with readings during the first half of the course. Classes were often based more on lectures than on discussion, so if you value the seminar component I would encourage you to be more active during the discussion portions of class.
Do the reading!
