A good class to take if you're interested in knowing more about Kant and would like a sweeping overview which focuses more on breadth than depth.
Take this course if you want to have a broad view of Kant's moral and political writings. Based om my discussion with students who have taken Kant classes in other departments, this course offers the chance to engage with a much larger number of texts than is often the case. Also, Professor Riley's unique perspective on Kant shouldn't be missed.
You can get away with not doing a lot of reading, but if you choose to do it, you'll cover all of Kant's important texts (philosophy/morals/politics/religion/etc), which is important and useful to just get under your belt.
This class offers the greatest way to learna about kant in a comprehensive manner
It's Kant. You should know Kant.
Probably the most intellectually stimulating course I took at Harvard (as an undergrad.) It is admittedly extremely niche; only take this if you are really interested in the questions of theodicy (in a Protestant context) and their implications on political theory.
