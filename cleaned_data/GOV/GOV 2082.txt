Lots of reading
Throughout the course of this class you will learn the history and intellectual effect of a particular thinker (Marx in this case) on political thought. For that alone, Professor Tuck's thoroughness is appreciated. But the reading is hard, and the class is very competent. It's easy to feel inadequate in the class, but going through the canonical works is enough to make it worth it. Not a class for beginners.
