This is by far the best gov seminar I've taken. Janet Lewis is awesome (unfortunately, she taught this in her last year at Harvard).
Incredible course. It's unfortunate that Harvard is losing Dr. Lewis as she is spectacular at running a class-- from guided classroom discussion to a thorough and exciting syllabus to quality assignments, this course receives high marks across the board. One of the best classes I have ever taken at Harvard.
This is an excellent course! I loved the subject material, atmosphere of general discussion, and professor teaching it.
This was one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. It is very sad that Janet is leaving. She is by far the best professor I have had - accessible, brilliant, designed a great course, and gave great feedback. Couldn't have asked for a better class!
This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. I know that this course has provided me with the knowledge to both continue my studies and perhaps apply for a job related to international relations and interventions. I am so happy I took this class!
There is a ton of reading, and the discussions are challenging.
great class! any interest in developing countries, definitely take this class
