Depending on who is running it, this can be a great workshop (this year it was very successful I thought). Participants read the papers and consistently offer comments that are helpful and thoughtful.
enroll if you have IR research to present and receive feedback on.
This course is fantastic.  Even when you aren't presenting you can learn a great deal about international relations and (perhaps more importantly) the discipline.  If you are interested in IR, you should be attending this workshop.
One of the best research workshops in the gov department.
