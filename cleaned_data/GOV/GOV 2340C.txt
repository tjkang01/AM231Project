Make sure your seminar paper is as complete as possible in order to ensure you get as valuable feedback as possible. Be aware that disciplinary norms vary substantially, and the feedback you receive will reflect that.
This question only applies to social policy fellows so my recommendation doesn't really mean anything because the course is a requirement.  Nevertheless, I would recommend trying to know something about your invited discussant beforehand, other than their field of interest.  I had met my discussant before and got excellent feedback the day I presented my paper; I observed that other students' discussants really varied in the quality of their comments and interest in the papers they were commenting on, such that I'm not sure their feedback was all that terribly helpful for the students.
