This class is awesome. Great professor, great material, not too much time commitment but still reall engaging. It was great, take it.
Any student who is even moderately interested in feminism and gender roles, regardless of prior knowledge of the material, should definitely take this course!
Emma is an excellent instructor. She is well-versed in social theory at large and the feminist theory that she teaches. She is also great at providing productive pushback that keeps class interesting and dynamic.
I recommend this class for students of government. This class has a lot of potential and with improvement this class will become one of the most important courses in the department.
This course offers a solid background in feminist theory and demonstrates how it intersects with many different schools of thought such as post-modernism and liberalism. The readings are fair and present a variety of perspectives.
This has been one of the best courses I have taken at Harvard and that is all due to the wonderful teaching I experienced.
