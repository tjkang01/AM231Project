It will change/challenge/inform your way of looking at the world. Please take classes that do that.
It was an awesome lass that will fascinate students of all academic interests and backgrounds. We covered everything from the drug war in the US to coca in Peru and Colombia to South American indigenous movements to the processes of globalization and more. The magnitude of the topics got a little overwhelming, but overall, this class was amazing.
This was a great introduction to issues and politics in Latin America, specifically the Andean region. The assignments allow one to engage with the material that he/she finds most interesting, and I think that is a key element of a successful class.
This class has a lot of knowledge to offer, and is definitely interesting and engaging, but be prepared to be proactive and ready to organize yourself.
a lot of reading and writing but it is very interesting and professor theidon is amazing.
Definitely take it!
This is the kind of class you should take at Harvard.
