if you have to take Theory, take it with Matt Liebmann
This seminar provided me with a structured environment to address theoretical  questions that I had had for some time, and to discover new problems that I was previously unaware of. A great way to begin thinking more deeply and broadly about how and why archaeology matters, and the problems intrinsic to the discipline.
That it is very fun and we were able to engage in great discussions.
This course is a lot of work. The readings are generally quite dense, so it really helps to take notes as you go.
This is a great introduction to theory in archaeology, just be ready to read a lot!
If Prof. Flad is teaching this course, you will need to read. A lot. However, he knows the material, engages in it with the rest of the class, and helps lead good discussions around the various concepts, which makes the work manageable/useful.
It's a good theory course, but you have to like theory, of course.
Anyone thinking of pursing a career in archaeology must take this course
You'll walk away with a solid foundation of archaeological theory and skills in class discussion and leadership.
This course requires a lot of work, but provides an excellent background in theory, as well as good discussion.
'Well, the bad news is you have to take this course whether you like it or not. The good news: it's a fun ride, you'll learn a lot, and it's a heck of a lot better than prosem2. Just remember to take good notes on the readings.
Take this class with Matt Liebmann!
