If you're not used to reading a book a week for one class, don't take it.  Also, since it's a discussion based seminar type of class, don't take it if you don't like speaking up in class.  Prof. Harkness can be heavy on theory but don't let that intimidate you or deter you from taking the class.  I learned so much from him and some of that theory really helps when you have to write your own research papers or project proposals for other classes.  Plus, he simplifies them for you and makes them so much more approachable, so that really helps too.
This class is very low work load, no section, no midterm, no final exam (just a final paper). I would recommend it to anyone who is interested in contemporary South Korea. This course counts for a secondary in East Asian Studies. Professor Harkness is also one of my favorite professors at Harvard!
Absolutely the most interesting course I have taken at Harvard. Of course, an interest in Korean culture is advised, but aside from this the class is a great introduction to Anthropology and to ethnography more specifically. Professor Harkness is an amazing teacher and if you are interested in East Asian Studies or Anthropology at all I recommend taking this class with him. He is extremely approachable, helpful and brings a very interesting analytical viewpoint to all readings. Great intro to the major ethnographies relating to South Korea.
This class offers broad exposure to a number of fascinating facets of Korean culture.  The ethnographies we read are great, and Professor Harkness always facilitates and leads very fruitful and interesting discussions.  Definitely take it.
Definitely take this class if you're interested in learning more about contemporary South Korea.
