With Tom teaching this class, I would recommend it to anyone. With a midterm paper and a final paper as the only real assignments with "micro-responses" due every weekend, it was a light workload, low attendance requirement, and not very hard.
This course was extremely informative. The readings were engaging and the discussions were illuminating. Ozden-Schilling was a great lecturer. I would recommend any class he teaches.
Course that is great, but requires you to push and think critically.
A fantastic course. If you ever get the chance, take this class. It completely changed the way I look at modern North America.
