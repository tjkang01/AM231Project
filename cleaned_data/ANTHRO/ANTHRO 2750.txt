Take this class to think through the relationship between social and biological factors.
not as interesting as it sounds
A great opportunity that you shouldn't pass up.
It is a really interesting class, but only take it if you are internally motivated to do the reading, because otherwise its easy to just coast along and then feel as if you didn't get as much out of it as you would have liked.  When you do the reading, it is really interesting.
If you're interested in medical anthropology and specifically in Arthur Kleinman's work, then this is a must-take class. If you are at all ambivalent, however, the two hours and heavy readings might drag a little.
you have to like the material, particularly biology and sciences, to enjoy this class
This is a high level class but it's also very accessible. Prof. Kleinman is inspiring!
It has fascinating readings but having only a couple of assignments makes grading difficult as well as the end of the semester when you have to write the paper.
