This course introduces you to a set of scholarship that examines pertinent questions related to governance, religion, and secularism in India. While this course examines South Asia from key thematics like communalism, law, nationalism, etc., it also moves beyond this approach to engage with theoretical underpinnings of such themes. Therefore, in conversations and texts, it is not Gandhi, Ambedkar, the RSS, etc. that are pivotal figures but Foucault, Weber, Durkheim, Marx, etc. as well.
Do as much of the reading as you possibly can--don't skim. It will be so much more helpful if you do a close reading.
