A wonderful introduction to political and legal anthropology, taught by a very talented and engaged instructor (Prof. Theidon). The material is often challenging, provocative, and at times very dense, but it is well worth it.  For students inside and especially outside of anthropology, an excellent way to reorient your vision of the political world.
The class brings together foundational texts (Foucault, Gramsci, etc) with innovative works of legal anthropology on law, magic, and justice. Topic is fascinating, and the professor is an eloquent and inspirational scholar.
A challenging, thought provoking, and very rewarding course. Facilitates new ways of looking at issues of law and governance, in a rigorous but refreshingly open minded setting.
