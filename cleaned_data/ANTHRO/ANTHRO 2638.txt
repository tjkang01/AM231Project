It's very good but dense
Asad is a wonderful teacher, and anyone taking any class with him is likely to come away a better scholar. It *is* difficult if you don't have a background in politics or anthropology, but if you commit to the course and plough through the readings each week, you will learn a lot. Feel free to ask the 'stupid question' in class; Asad will always make you realize you asked something pertinent.
Be prepared to work hard on deciphering the readings and expect high-level discussion from your coursemates. Professor Ahmed is willing to help you understand the material, but you certainly have to reach out if you need it. A strong background in anthropology is highly recommended.
