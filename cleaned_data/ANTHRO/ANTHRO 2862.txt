If you are interested in anthropology at all, you need to take a course with Arthur Kleinman. Besides being incredibly knowledgeable, he also is supportive and helpful in encouraging students to engage with the text. I wish all pre-med and med students were required to take a class with him.
It's a great opportunity to learn from the instructor who has been at the forefront of the field himself.
Anyone interested in the Anthropology of Medicine should take this course. Professor Kleinman is an enthusiastic and supportive instructor that brings with him a life-time of experience as a pioneer of the Anthropology of Medicine.
Great course, opportunity to learn more from an amazing professor
Fascinating and absorbing course with great readings.
