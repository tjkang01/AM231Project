This is a great class to take if you don't know very much about the sharia and are looking for a solid grounding. It's also great if you want to introduce yourself to anthropology through a non-intro course.
This is a spectacular course for anyone interested in law, anthropology, or Islam. If you are uncomfortable in these areas, Ahmed is great at helping you out and providing a groundwork, so don't worry. This course would not be beneficial, however, if you don't have an interest in rights and the challenges that Islamic law and Muslim culture present to liberalism. If you do have this interest, this course is a must-take.
It was a difficult class with a lot of reading, but the materials were interesting and Professor Ahmed was extremely knowledgeable.
There are so many horrible misconceptions about the Shari'ah - and about Islam - in the US (and on this campus) that courses like this should almost be a requirement. The workload is spread evenly throughout the semester and the lectures/discussion are great.
If you're at all interested in Islam or Islamic law, take this class. You will love it  and you'll learn so much, too. I'm a math major  I took this just as an elective  and it was probably my favourite class this semester.
