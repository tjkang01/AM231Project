The bibliography assignments take time, but they will be worth it down the road when you want to reference that one article you kind-of sort-of remember from that class way back when.
If you want to learn a lot about archaeological theory, about applying theory to sites, and about issues within production and how they relate to other issues within archaeology, then this is a good class for you. Going even deeper, if you are looking for a class to challenge your very assumptions about who you are and how you identify yourself as a person and on what bases, you will find that challenge here. The class is about understanding the past, but engaging with this material is sure to provoke self-reflection on your own identity here in the present.
Very demanding course in terms of reading and end of the year work, but you learn alot and get in the thick of interesting discussions
