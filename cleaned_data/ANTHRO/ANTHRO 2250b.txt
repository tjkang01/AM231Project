The professors do a lot of the talking and impart extensive knowledge and create good discussion.  They all have different perspectives.  This class is a wonderful and unique opportunity to get to know multiple professors.

This does not seem to be particularly useful for generals studying. You will learn quite a bit, but it seems kind of incoherent.
Go in ready to discuss (and defend) your points of view.  Be ready to be proven wrong. Staying on the sidelines is boring, and the think-on-your-feet style of academic argument is the point.
While the professors are engaging and the class is stimulating, it does not necessarily prepare you for general exams.
This class is generally only taken by first and second year archaeology grad students, as it is required.
