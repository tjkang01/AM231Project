This class is a great class. Prof Cho is a great professor. He really cares about students and their progress in the class. I learnt a great deal and I became really interested in anthropology because of this class. It helped me begin to think about the world in a new way. Also, this class really helped my writing a lot because of the individualized attention. I think I learnt skills that I would be using for a long time :)
I knew nothing about Korea when I came into the class, and now I feel like I have a great understanding about Korea's history and transition to the post-modern world. We talked about some fascinating topics, like plastic surgery and contract marriages, and overall I enjoyed the course.
This is a fascinating course if you're interested at all in learning about the history and culture of both North and South Korea! It's also a great introduction to Anthropology as a field in general, exposing you to how anthropologists write and terms like "neoliberal subjectivity," "globalization," and other buzzwords you hear about all the time but don't quite understand.
The material is very interesting and you learn a lot about various aspects of South Korea's modern society but it was incredibly hard to produce independent interpretations of the readings and creative essays because the instructor tried to impose his interpretation as the only correct one.
The material for this class is extremely interesting, and anyone who is interested in studying Korea or living/working in Korea (even native Koreans) should take this course. Gives a historical overview and discussion of major themes in contemporary Korean culture. Professor Cho is interested in teaching students not only about the course materials but also about academia, especially anthropology. He is quite particular about expectations for the papers, so be sure to meet with him before turning in your final drafts.
