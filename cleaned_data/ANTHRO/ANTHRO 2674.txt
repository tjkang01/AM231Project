Take it if you really want to learn through and through some of the main theoretical materials associated with anth of law.
I would tell them that this is a fantastic course with a great professor, with a theory component unlike many of the other classes taught in the same department.
Difficult course but incredibly informative.
This is a very challenging but also extremely rewarding class, so be prepared to put in a lot of work for weekly readings, response papers, and discussion group posts. Professor Ahmed is a wonderful professor, and it was a pleasure to be part of our this seminar. We were a small group with diverse backgrounds (anthropology, political theory, 'area studies', etc.) but I've had some of my best discussions during my time at Harvard. Whilst I am not an anthropologist, this seminar has taught me a lot and opened my eyes to many issues related to law, legalities, and modern governance. It should be interesting for a wide range of students. Definitely recommend!
