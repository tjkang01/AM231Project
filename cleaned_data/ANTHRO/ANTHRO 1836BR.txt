Take it, take it seriously.
An intensive course  in which the value of what make will depend upon what you put into it, and that means stretching your mind, courage and ability!
The two-part Sensory Ethnography sequence is an incredible opportunity to develop and execute your own cinematic vision and to receive helpful and supportive feedback from the instructors and fellow students all along the way. It is a major, major time commitment, but if it becomes a labor of love for you (as I believe it did for most everyone in our class), it will be beyond worth it.
This course sequence has been the most transformative of any of the courses I've taken at Harvard. The intense demands challenged me in ways I hadn't experienced before, and left me with a number of truly life-changing experiences, both while shooting in the field, and while editing and working through critiques during the course. The beauty of the course lies in the commitment of the students and instructors to the works being produced, and before signing on for the course, students should expect for it to radically alter the rhythms of their life and thought.
Recommend with enthusiasm and trepidation. (They might not know what they're in for!) :)
Robb and Mary are a great combination for teaching this course. They are both extremely caring and encouraging, but also constructively critical without discouraging you. In this class, you'll learn to bring out the strength of your piece with weekly screening and critics in class. But this does not means that you could work the minimal hours and wait for your class to help you out. This class is most beneficial when you love your project and are willing to invest time to cut the best version you could before presenting it to the class.
