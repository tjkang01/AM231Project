While the course title is anthropology of governance, note that it does not deal only with anthropology of the state governance or public administration but a wider range such as health, security, science, population.
You gain an understanding of the multiple and interlocking systems, institutions, and discourses that are at stake in contemporary political forms and processes.  You develop a better idea of how to "think" and methodologically approach the study of multi-scalar, multi-faced, complex sociopolitical phenomena.
This is a class that enables you engage with a wide range of readings and gives you a good grounding into the different ways that anthropologists ask questions of the state.
