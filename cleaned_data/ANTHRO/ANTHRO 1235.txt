I'm not particularly interested in archaeology, so it was often difficult to get really interested in the material, unless you were working really closely with a reading or set of readings for your presentation or a response or something. That said, if you DO like archaeology, you'll probably love this class.
It's really an interesting class. The discussions are fun.
The assignments are fun, varied, manageable, and engaging. Other than the Gamble textbook, I enjoyed the weekly readings. Very fun class activities (making stone tools!) and I enjoyed the hands on aspect of this class.
Definitely need to have an HEB foundation to take. But it was a very interesting and low-stress class. We got to see and hold actual artifacts in class on a regular basis, which was really exciting and gave me appreciation for the ingenuity of ancient humans. Everyone leads a discussion at some point in the semester which can take some time to prepare but the professors are very open to helping you.
Great to meet the evolution requirement, but kind of tedious at times. Readings are complicated but total understanding not required. Just try to do them. Grading is fair and papers are painless. The professors are really cool and funny. You'll get to see some really cool artifacts made by Neanderthals and ancient humans.
