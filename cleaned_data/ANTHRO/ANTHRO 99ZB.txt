This is a thesis tutorial and it is exactly what it needs to be to help you get the job done.
This class proved integral to my thesis writing process. The feedback you get from your TF and classmates is extremely valuable.
The thesis tutorial in Anthro is the best. Period.
Time to get writing! It's definitely worth it in the end!
Senior thesis tutorial is such a critical part of the thesis-writing process. I really learned a lot from being able to share drafts with others & read other people's drafts & share feedback. It also was incredibly helpful to develop a relationship with our tutorial leader, a PhD candidate, and to have that sort of personalized feedback and support throughout the thesis-writing process. It's a humbling experience, and I felt like a grew not only as a writer, but also as a peer / advisee / learner.
I had two thesis tutorials and this was much better than the other one.
