If you have any interest in Bangkok, Thailand, or Thai food, this is the perfect class for you. It also allows you to pursue your own topical interest within the regional area.
Take this course! It was an amazing introduction to both anthropology as a concentration/discipline, as well as an awesome immersion in all things Thai. I recommend this class with a very great amount of enthusiasm.
Absorb as much as possible!
