Excellent introduction to one of the mainstays of archaeological research.  Be prepared for a total immersion in the production literature!
If you want to study the archaeology of production or economic anthropology, take the course (and the archaeology of trade, offered in alternate years)
It will be very useful for backing up the background knowledge in future research. Also, the discussion is very inspiring
This is a challenging course that a student can get a great deal out of, but you have to put the work in to reap the benefit.
this class is meant as an upper level seminar in anthropology and for those it is eminently suitable.
