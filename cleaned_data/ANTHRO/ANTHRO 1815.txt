It's a pretty painless course and very interesting if you like minority studies.
This class is engaging and fun. It has a lot of reading some weeks...but so is every class!
This course offers a great overview of both the history of various Asian American groups and the factors that have shaped their experience in the US today.
I would "recommend with reservations" not because this wasn't a good class - in fact, it was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Rather, I could imagine people who are unfamiliar with the concepts presented in class/unfamiliar with anthropology would struggle. This class was very theory-based and difficult for an undergraduate course. I learned a ton, but sometimes the concepts flew over my head. We had great discussions because mostly everyone was a senior or had vested interest in the topic. This is not a class for someone looking for a casual elective.
It's a really good class with little work.  You need to be able to keep up with the readings and discussion in class, but so long as you have a personal interest in the material, you'll love it.
