Lamberg-Karlovsky knows his subject material and imbues every aspect of the course with his enthusiasm. His stories and first hand accounts of past field projects are profound and of great educational value. If you have any interest in pre-history, conflict, national interests, intrigue, or human nature - take this course!
This is a class in which the ratio of learning to workload is quite high.  You get a lot of bang for your buck with the professor, whose lectures are both informative and entertaining.  The amount of reading is relatively low, but the textbook is very detailed. I came away knowing a great deal more than I had about the Near East, past and present.
It's a really easy class - there's no work and i actually learned a lot.
Not a ton of work and interesting, but oddly set up. No syllabus.
Fun if you have an interest in the material and want something to begin with. Not so fun if you plan to just cruise through without engaging.
Boring.
This class is a great class if you're looking for a laid-back course filled with great information and personal anecdotes of archaeological digs. The professor is very knowledgable!
Small class taught entirely by the Professor, a verified archaeological legend. Interjections and class discussions welcomed
The man has opinions, and is quite happy for you to have some of your own, too.
Only take this class if you have a strong background in the middle east, archaeology or anthropology and are seeking more depth in this specific area.
This is a wonderful class--Professor Lamberg-Karlovsky is fantastic, it's like having a class with Indiana Jones.
This was a really interesting course, and it was really easy, but I felt like I learned a lot.
The course is very stress-free, made up completely of slideshow-based lectures without required reading or work outside of a couple silly paper assignments.
