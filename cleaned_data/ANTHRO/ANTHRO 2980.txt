Excellent readings and very good introduction to them and broader issues presented each week by Mary Steedly.
A fantastic, thorough, and highly engaging introduction to major streams of thought in anthropology, centered around the "culture" concept.  Be prepared for a good amount of work and reading, with weekly (1 page) assignments, coupled with 3-4 longer essays.  But, should you complete the course, you will come away with a broad and critical understanding of some of anthropology's central questions and debates, as well as a sense of the direction in which it is currently heading.  Highly recommended.
This course offers a strong foundation in cultural anthropology, and I'd recommend it to anyone who wants to understand/engage in the dialogue of anthropological theory.
