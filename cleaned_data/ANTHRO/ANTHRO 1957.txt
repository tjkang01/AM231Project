This course will change the way that you see scientific thinking and the processes of laboratory work, and can provide incredible insights into the formation of the field which define our era of knowledge making. It's also incredibly interesting and has been one of the more relevant courses I've taken at Harvard.
If you are interested in either anthropology OR science (or even related fields like the philosophy of science), you should take this course! It will really challenge your preconceptions about how science works in practice.
