It is rare to take a course with a small class size at Harvard. That in itself is a plus. By taking this course, you will learn the basics behind the many Mesoamerican writing systems and writing's influence on different cultures and vice versa.
This is a really great class!  Classes like this are a rare opportunity to learn something completely new.  I would recommend it highly to anyone with any interest in epigraphy or archaeology.
