I highly recommend this class to anyone who wants a deeper understanding of the current events in Greece.  I learned something new and fascinating at every meeting.  Herzfeld provides useful feedback on all assignments and is accessible outside of class.
Professor Herzfeld is incredibly knowledgeable! This class felt a bit more like story time than a formal lecture and it was incredible! A great course for someone looking to learn about Greek culture and be entertained by a wonderful teacher. Be aware, even though Prof. Herzfeld is relaxed he does expect a lot from his students. You need to show up to every lecture and be ready to participate. This class is really a gem.
