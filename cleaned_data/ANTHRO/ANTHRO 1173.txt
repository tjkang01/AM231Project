This is one of my favorite classes I've ever taken at Harvard. Great stuff. I have never studied archaeology but it was awesome.
You will only get out of this course what you bring to it.  If you bring to it only a desire to get a good grade, you may get that, but you might not experience the full depths of the archeological discipline.  However, if you come with an open mind and put in concerted effort, you will learn a lot about the Maya, in a relatively informal class atmosphere, and you can explore the wealth of resources at Harvard.  It was truly a gift for me, for instance, to be able to discover some of the archives at Harvard, and to write a paper based on what I found.  But do be prepared to put in weekly effort, of your own accord (since it won't be forced upon you) in order to benefit from this course.
If you have an interest in Mesoamerica, or ancient culture, go for it
This is a great introduction to Maya archaeology, and the professor was so enthusiastic. Sections were interesting, and usually involved expert guest speakers or looking at ceramics from Harvard's incredible collection. Low work load, and the professor makes it clear what is expected of you. Definitely would recommend if you have any interest in archaeology.
