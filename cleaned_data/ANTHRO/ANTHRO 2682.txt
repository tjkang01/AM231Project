A very strong teacher teaching about interesting subject matter, but the graduate student component needs to be developed more fully.
Tokyo is a fascinating city and this class provides a rich introduction to it, and other aspects of Japanese culture.
This course is basically directed reading with a paper - plus attendance of the Gen Ed lecture course. You need to be self-motivated in order to get the most out of it.
If you are interested in Tokyo and Japanese culture, you should definitely take this class.
This course is both informative and very open-ended, so it gives you a lot of useful knowledge and you can apply this to your own focused topic.
