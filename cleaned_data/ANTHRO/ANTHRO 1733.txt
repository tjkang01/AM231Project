I highly recommend you this course if you are interested in ethnography and you believe that film is a good way to convey your insights. It is not a class of filming though, but a class of how to convey ethnographic information through film. If you are interested in improving your technical skills for filming you should take and additional course in addition to this. The combination of both may be highly rich.
Be prepared to be an independent thinker! Your projects will only be as good as your own effort. Although this is a course with instruction about intimate ethnographic filmmaking, you will have to do many self-directed assignments in order to get the maximum benefit of the film class! It is very "hands on", so be prepared to take that seriously.
