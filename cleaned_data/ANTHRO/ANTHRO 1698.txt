This course was a bit different than I expected, but I would still give it a 4. We had great discussions and fascinating readings, but I would have been interested to look into portrayals of death and the afterlife in popular culture as well as in historical/social contexts. The films we watched were primarily documentaries, and it would have been interested to watch different kinds of movies (i.e. horror and/or fiction) to get a different perspective. Also, I did not receive any feedback on my written work throughout the semester, which at times made it difficult to know what Professor Bernstein was expecting or what I could do to improve. Still, it was a solid seminar.
The material covered in this class is very interesting but not necessarily applicable to anything else. I did not develop skills that were otherwise applicable to anything else, though I do not regret taking the course by any means. If you are curious about how death is perceived in other cultures, or how to better frame life versus death in society, especially w=given advancing technologies for preserving "life", take this class.
If you are interested in gritty truths, the depth of human emotion, sometimes gory imagery, but always a meaningful analysis, then this course is for you.
