Be ready to be led through a vast array of social theory works -- it is not easy!
This class is a great way to learn about social theory surrounding the African continent over a long span of time!
I enthusiastically recommend everything taught by the Comaroffs. Social Theory, Anthropology of Law, and Africa Rising have been the intellectual highlights of my time at Harvard. Throughout all three courses, I have been consistently engaged and challenged and feel that Ive learned valuable new ways to analyze economic, legal, political, medical, and social issues. Even more importantly, John and Jean are awesomely brilliant and supportive.
