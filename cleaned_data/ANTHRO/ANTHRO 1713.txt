Take this course! It will change how you think about socioeconomic rights and give you both theoretical and practical frameworks to enable you to frame and articulate your thoughts. These are necessary skills in today's world, in which these issues are now at the forefront. You shouldn't be deterred if you've never studied social theory or anthropology before - I was in the same boat. Fortunately, the Professor, though brilliant, is willing to help you through the material and strives to make sure you understand it. She knows that most people have little background in the subject and selects readings that, while challenging, are doable. Moreover, the assignments are evaluated accordingly. There are two papers, one short response paper and one longer term paper, and both are amazing in that she allows you to choose a topic in which you're genuinely interested. There's no busy work - unlike some Harvard classes, this one won't leave you feeling like you've wasted your time. I can't rave enough about this class and Professor Chance. Do yourself the favor, and take it if she offers it again next year!
Take if you are interested in the material on the syllabus.
The class is pretty interesting, and the subject matter is pretty engaging. There is a lot of reading assigned, however, most of it isn't essential simply because you can read the parts relevant to your final paper.
Take this course if you have a background in anthropology and would like a stronger familiarity with human rights and economic rights.
If you have a background on political anthropology the course might not add to your knowledge. If you dont, it will.
This course is an excellent way to understand Neoliberalism in the modern anthropological context. Professor Chance is brilliant, and encourages students to bring their own research into the seminar.
