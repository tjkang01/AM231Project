Take this class! The professor is great and the material is manageable/interesting.
If you are interested in learning about the Maya specifically from what they wrote, the class is perfect. However, if you are not passionate about this subject matter, you will probably be bored.
very interesting class and a great introduction to the maya culture.  the professor is really nice and encourages interaction with the material.
Prof. Tokovinine is an upcoming professor at Harvard! Be sure to catch one of his classes. He's amazing!
Well worth it!
