prepare more time than you think you need for readings
Three hours straight of two professors lecturing in an unorganized fashion kind of sucked the life out of me. It's a fine class but it'd be better to just obtain the syllabus and read what's on it.
I'm glad this is a new required course for graduate students in archaeology.  It's essential and should have existed all along.
only if you have to or are really interested in these topics!
Be prepared to dedicate the majority of your semester to this class. Because of the small size of the class, discussion depends on the preparedness of the discussion leader and discussants, and can easily be dominated or held back by one or two people. Instructors are excellent, friendly and engaging and seem genuinely invested in the quality of the course.
