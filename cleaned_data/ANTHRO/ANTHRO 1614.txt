This class was really fun to be in. I thought it raised a lot of really interesting questions that were applicable to contemporary living.
1614 was a great and fun course! Professor Ibrahim provides interesting readings and promotes engaging conversations in class! The class is divided into three units: photography, television, and digital worlds. I got to write about family photographs, my own television viewing preferences and habits, and on a website of choice. Some of the terms in visual anthropology were a little difficult to grasp, but Professor Ibrahim did a great job in clarifying them, so you're in good hands!
This course was not bad but not good. Class ended up being a dry lecture most of the time, and I think with the topic the readings and discussion could have done a lot more. We received no feedback until reading period which was frustrating. Overall, this course is pretty forgettable.
A great seminar on very interesting and relevant topics. The class as a whole was quite informal and relaxed. The papers were flexible in terms of what you could write about.
