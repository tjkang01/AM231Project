A great class if you're interested in the subject. Will introduce you to a lot of important theorists and also provide many interesting case studies. Not a difficult class to do well in if you have experience in social sciences/religion, but might be difficult for students just starting out.
This is a fantastic introduction to anthropology of religion. Excellent readings strike the right balance between theory and case studies. Anya is a great teacher and very knowledgeable in the field.
This is a challenging course that is well-designed and moderated.
You will learn an interesting perspective from this class - one that, in my experience, is not commonly taught in most Anthropology of Religion courses.  The information presented is both interesting and useful.
I highly recommend this class if you are interested in the material; otherwise, this class has a lot of work and critical thinking through reading sources that may not be enjoyed by students who are taking it for an elective rather than due to genuine interest.
This class is much harder than you expect it to be, because there is a lot of reading that you really do need to know (small class, easy to tell if you haven't done the reading because the prof. goes around and asks everyone about it each week). Assignments are almost wholly essays, and she grades essays pretty harshly so even if the page numbers are small you need to be prepared to expend a lot of effort to get a good grade.
