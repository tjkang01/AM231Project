This course explores different facets of social change in contemporary China, from urbanization to environmentalism, but takes an approach that blurs the distinction between state and society and examines new kinds of relationships between the two. The readings and films are all incredibly interesting because they bring forth personal perspectives, which in turn inform our understanding of the larger structural changes taking place. Take this class if you are at all interested in what is going on in China, a country that has completely reconfigured its political and socioeconomic bearings in a matter of several decades. A background in anthropology might help but is definitely not required to gain something from this course and contribute meaningfully to discussions!
You will get out of it what you put into it, like many other classes. If you have enough time, the readings can be super interesting.
This is a comprehensive course if you are trying to understand the social issues of contemporary China.
