Take it if you have an interest in archeology.
The professor is great, but it hard to know what information is important to retain for the exams.
This class has a great teacher, and while the Bawden readings can be a bit tedious at times, the Pillsbury readings are fascinating. It doesn't require a lot of work, but th two exams and final paper make sure that one does walk away with increased knowledge.
This course is really fun and interesting!
One of the best classes I have taken at Harvard.
I came in knowing nothing about the Moche and left with much more than new understanding of a different culture.
It's a great option for Lit B-- not that difficult, extremely interesting, and an engaging professor.
Pick a pot which people took time to actually discuss or else the term paper will be difficult!
plan ahead for the final paper: pick a topic and know what sort of a pot you need for that.
It's a great class to take. While it's not extremely rigorous, you do have to pay attention to pass and it's extremely enjoyable. I would take any class that Professor Quilter teaches, he's outstanding. He could make the the life of a snail sound interesting and worthwhile.
The professor is kind of goofy, so if you can dig his teaching style, you will dig this class.
You should be interested in iconography and archaeology.
It's a fun gen ed course.
very interesting look into an unheard of culture.  lots of fun and you'll actually learn a lot.  be prepared for the questioning looks of others when you tell you what classes you're taking though
Split the readings with a few friends, and each of you take notes.
Great professor, great class, I have told my academic advisor to recommend it to other students as a great way to fulfill the Lit-B requirement.
