This is a good course for people with some prior knowledge of South Asia and a strong interest in the region. You get to grapple with a lot of big ideas about religion, politics, liberalism, secularism, and societal divisions. The amount of reading is manageable.
I would highly recommend any of Professor Ahmed's classes to students who are interested in studying South Asia. This course's material was very interesting and the readings were well selected to give insight into many different points of view about a week's topic.
For anyone interested in anthropology this is a perfect course.
