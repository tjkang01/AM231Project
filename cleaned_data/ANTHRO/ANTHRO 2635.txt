You will get a lot out of this class if you take it as an opportunity to experiment with your current theoretical assumptions about images and political and public life.
This is an extremely wonderful and well organized course. You will learn a lot from this class and change the way you see photos, films and yourself! Mary Steedly really makes this class, she's the ultimate teacher.
This course can be great for people interested in the social life of images. To get the most out of the class one really has to take the reigns in the discussions to direct the conversations otherwise you may end up watching 10 minutes of clips of the Profs dogs on YouTube.
This is a great class in terms of the material you cover - it makes you think very hard about a lot of the technological and social media around you and how that is affecting everything from production of art to the creation of publics. Discussions can sometimes be very abstract, but are often times grounded in real-life examples (you are encouraged to bring in media to show), which is perhaps the best part of this class. If you're into images, media, marketing or any combination of the sorts, you should definitely shop the class to see if it gells with your interest.
