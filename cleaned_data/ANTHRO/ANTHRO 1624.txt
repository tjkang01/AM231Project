Excellent course that introduces you to political theorists and anthropological literature that examines political economics from an ethnographic perspective. Professor is excellent.
only if you're willing to be very challenged intellectually
Some familiarity with political theory would have been helpful
This class has challenging material and covers advanced concepts in political anthropology, but at the same time, the coursework is quite manageable. You learn a lot without exhausting yourself in the process.
