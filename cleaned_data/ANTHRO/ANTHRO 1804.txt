really fun and interesting class. different from most other classes taken at harvard!
This course inspired some really fascinating discussions in class and outside of class. The reading material was great, too. Really really enjoyed this class and strongly recommend it!
This is a great class -- it provides an interesting discourse around the culture and anthropology of food. The professor is very insightful and curates a top notch set of topics to discuss. Definitely take it if Nico is still around!
If you're interested in food, this course will give you a great view on the social sciences analysis of food-related issues. Nico is a friendly, knowledgable professor and I had a great time in the course!
This class is amazing- but only if you truly care about the topics and want to invest time in deeply discussing specific points of food.
It was probably the class that I enjoyed the most this semester, because the professor, the students, the content, and the atmosphere for discussion all worked very well together. If the topic is of any interest to you, I would highly recommend it!
Strongly recommended, you will really enjoy the class and taste real food throughout the semester!
