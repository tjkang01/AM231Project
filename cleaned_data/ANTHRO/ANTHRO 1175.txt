This is a really incredible class!  It was a lot of work, but definitely worth it.  The readings were interesting, and the discussions were some of the best I've had at Harvard.
This is an interesting class, Prof. Urton is wonderful and the subject material is interesting.  Might be a bit more difficult for someone not interested in or knowledgeable about anthropology/archaeology.
Ethnicity is an important question in archaeology and reading this literature really enhanced my grasp of it.
Topic of this course is what all archaeologists face all the time and we can not ignore issues related to ethnicity in our career. Thus, it is necessary to have better understanding of ethnicity and ethnic identity.
