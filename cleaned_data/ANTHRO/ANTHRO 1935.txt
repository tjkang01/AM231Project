This class is very interesting and a good introduction to questions concerning secularism and political theory.
You'll get to engage with some really fascinating issues and readings, though in the end you'll come out with more questions than answers. Sometimes gets a little anthro-jargony, but still worth it, and a nice mix of political philosophy and ethnographic readings.
You will learn so much about other cultures and really expand your thinking
For anyone interested in the globally relevant question of the relationship between secularism, politics, and religion today, this is a very interesting class.
