That the course is like stepping through the looking-glass or going down the rabbit-hole. Even an experienced filmmaker will emerge transformed.
It is an intense course, be prepared to devote most of your time to this class--but it is definitely worth it.
Thicken your skin. Learn from the controversial discussions in class but never narrow your vision. (Incidentally, I think there was a lot of pressure in the class to valorize a certain kind of vision of what filmmaking is/does ('house style', observational, ethnographic, etc.). I think those categories make sense as the focus of this class, but there should be less dogma about how this is the *only* way of making good films. I also think students should be exposed to other ways of working (not only the single-person writer/director/shooter/editor model but crews, as well). It is really important to get a sense of the MANY, MANY ways films get made.
Take this course if you are serious about understanding or examining other people or yourself through images, moving images, sound, and culture.  Class meetings are very intense and will tire you out; if you are often tired or inactive in class you won't gain anything.  Also, be aware that the course requires numerous outside screenings at the HFA, the Brattle Theatre, etc.
Only take this course if you are ready to spend +14 hours a week on assignment... If you do and are committed, the rewards endless.
Not a class for everyone. This class is like the kid at the birthday party screaming under the table in a foreign language. Its brilliant but its insane and not like other classes.
Such a fun and intellectually challenging  course! It asks a lot of hard questions which I really enjoyed thinking through. The assignments are also open so you have a lot of flexibility to pursue what most interests you.
