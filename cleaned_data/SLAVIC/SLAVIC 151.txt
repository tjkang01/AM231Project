It is a wonderful class, where you would learn a lot and discuss the nuances of Chekhov and Nabokov. It could be better organized and some of the deadlines and requirements for the course are not exact.
The readings are interesting and enjoyable, but this class is incredibly disorganized.
very good class for those with independent ideas, very little direction for those that don't
