Lectures are excellent and cover a surprising amount considering that the course topic spans most of a century and a range of media (literature, film, ballet, visual art, architecture). Really fun way to learn about the bizarre/tragic/beautiful directions Russian culture took in the 20th century, with all its utopian aspirations and aesthetic/ideological tensions.
Daria is so wonderful and her passion for the course material is contagious. The readings are all fascinating and I feel so much more informed/literate in 20th century Russian culture. She really just wants you to enjoy the class and explore with her. Almost no work for this class; we only had readings besides the final paper and all of them were interesting and enjoyable. Go to office hours!!
If you are at all interested in Slavic culture or intellectual history, you will definitely enjoy the course. All of the readings were excellent, and Prof. Khitrova is so smart and knowledgeable! A highlight of my semester.
