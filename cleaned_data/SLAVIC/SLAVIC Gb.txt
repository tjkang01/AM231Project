Professor Dibrova is a phenomenal professor and his course is a 10.  Regardless of your starting point, he is engaged and invested in your improvement in the language, and gives remarkably helpful instruction and feedback.  I recommend this course to anybody who has even the slightest interest in the Ukrainian language or culture; you will come away with an even greater enthusiasm and appreciation for the subject.
Be sure you want to take Ukrainian and not Russian. The class is small take advantage of that and have the class tailored to you needs.
Ukrainian is not a particularly easy language to pick up, especially if you have no knowledge of another Slavic lanugage, but this is a rewarding and interesting first-year language class with lots of work beyond basic grammar.
