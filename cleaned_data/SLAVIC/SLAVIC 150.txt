The course structure rewards genuine student interest, no matter how diverse, and the active participation of both students and professor is essential to the success of the course. Thus the course can be either highly rewarding or confused, depending on the participants, and I think the class would be most beneficial to advanced students with a pre-existing  and defined interest in the region.
This class is great for developing your project skills. I really enjoyed working on both the cultural sites project and my project proposal. By the end of the class, I was very passionate about both of my topics and wanted to keep working on them further! Another reason I took this class was to discuss Russian literature, and I was not disappointed in that regard. I felt I expanded my knowledge of Russian literature without things getting overly dry and theoretical for a non-specialist.
