I would say that this is the perfect course if you are looking to really go in depth analyzing one of the greatest Russian novels.
Slavic 251 is of the best courses I have taken at Harvard. The novel is exceptionally good, and Professor Buckler manages to make it even more enjoyable! I recommend this course as strongly as I have ever recommended as course. The workload is manageable, and the discussions are very enjoyable.
Anna Karenina, all semester, read with any focus or any context that you wish -- what's not to like?
Anna Karenina is a wonderful novel and Prof. Buckler is a skilled guide through Tolstoy's labyrinths.
