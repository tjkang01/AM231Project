you will learn a lot about Soviet cinema and have fun along the way!
Incredibly interesting course! One of the best I've taken at Harvard so far. However, only really suited for people already with a deep interest in the early Soviet period and film. Otherwise, without this deep interest, the amount of work that the class expects you to do each week would not really be worth it. If the interest and language skills are there, the class is just perfect.
