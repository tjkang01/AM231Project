One of the things that I like about this course is the amount of independence Nora gives you in learning the material. This is a great second semester course in Czech. However, the readings and listening exercises were slightly lacking. But overall very good. Nora is very helpful and a great teacher!
If you want to learn beginning Czech in a fun, friendly environment where it is okay to make mistakes as long as you try hard, take this class!
The class provides you with good conversational skills in Czech.
This course is a great introduction to Slavic languages and a good way to begin any study of Czech culture.
Czech is awesome!  The perfect beginner Slavic language.  and Nora is a great teacher.
It's really fun and Nora is great!
