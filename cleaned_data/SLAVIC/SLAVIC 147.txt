Really an incredible class. I can't imagine taking this class at another school. Probably the best part was being able to watch filmsand amazing ones at thatevery Monday morning. I really feel that I got a solid grounding in Russian film, something that is incredible for someone interested in Russia such as I am.
Excellent course both for film students and those interested in Russian/Soviet history and culture
