a great course overall. it can be difficult to find a course that deals with this time period! great exposure to various arts, and gives a good idea of how they interact with each other.
Great materials and a very interesting lecturer, though at times a bit disorganized.
I was very disappointed in this professor. It seems that at every turn she takes the easier road: not to care about her students' work; to purposefully misunderstand them, in fact; to assign her own writing so that she does not have to prepare for class (and it is quite obvious that she does not prepare)... She is a nice person who very much wants students to like her, but basically does not make any effort to earn their respect.This course also had a bad atmosphere. Students had no respect for each other or the professor (and she hardly made them feel like they had it from her).
I would tell them that the material is very interesting and the professor is excellent but that they need to participate to make taking the class worth it and in order to make sure they get what they want from it. In this instance of the class it seemed that some people spoke a lot and others not at all. This was silly not only in principle but also because I have a feeling that those who did not speak progressively lost enthusiasm for the course seeing that discussion revolved around what those who spoke brought up. This was unavoidable since it was the only thing put on the table for discussion, but it is a shame that so many voices were not heard during this class.
Do all readings in advance, if you can - you never know what you get to discuss in class!
