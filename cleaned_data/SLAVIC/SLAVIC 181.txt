Take this course to learn about a century of Russian poetry: how it developed, how it was written, and how one can enjoy it best. Take this course if you love Russian and love poetry.
This is a course that delves into the poetry of Pushkin's predecessors, contemporaries, and those who came after him. Prepare to work with metrics and be careful not to attribute to the poems more meaning than they hold, i.e. stick to the text and context in reading them. You will have to pay close attention to the professor's interpretations, because alternative ones, unless very well argued, will not be accepted. The grading is strict, so also be prepared to spend a significant amount of time on the essays.
How much advanced preparation the course demands.
Malmstad is wonderfully knowledgeable and you will learn a lot about metrics and formal analysis as well as about Russian 19th century poetry - its key players, major influences, conflicts, movements, etc. You will not, however, get to really engage with your classmates or even with Malmstad in discussions about it - he will lead it in a lecture format which is not conducive to questions. He firmly believes there is a right and a wrong answer. But great class in that I learned a new vocabulary and now feel that I know what I'm saying when I talk about poetry!
