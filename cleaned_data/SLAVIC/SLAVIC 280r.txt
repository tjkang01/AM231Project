This course is a must for any student who wishes to do advanced work in Russian literature, history, linguistics, etc., as it provides the foundation of Russian culture (the history of its formation, early cultural, religious, and judicial influences, etc.)  I believe that it may be a requirement for the Slavic grad students at Harvard, but if it's not, it should be, as too many Slavic grad programs are now ignoring or marginalizing medieval studies.
The class considers the most important contemporary scholarship on medieval Rus' from both Russia and the West
The workload is heavy, but you will benefit a lot from it and from the tremendous knowledge of the instructor!
You absolutely need this course to understand Russian culture and it also happens to be one of the best seminars I have ever taken!
The most fun you'll ever have studying Medieval Rus!
