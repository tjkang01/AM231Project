The best course I've taken. Prof. Khitrova is an informative, inspiring instructor, and with each two-hour lecture she painted a gorgeous picture of a particular moment in 18th-c. Russian literary history. Her affection for these authors is infectious.

The readings were formidable in vocab and volume, even for the grad students who had perfect fluency in Russian, but it was worth it.
This is your best chance to have a great 18th century Russian literature course -- Professor Khitrova presents her material with great richness and depth.
Good class; you learn a great deal about Russian literature!
Professor Khitrova is a delight, and anyone with an interest in Russian literature should take this course. Her lectures are illuminating and never boring. Take advantage of office hours!
