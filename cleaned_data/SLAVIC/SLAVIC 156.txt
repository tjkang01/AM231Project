Read the novels! They are great.
Great way to delve deeply into Nabokov! If you're interested in his writing, this course might be for you.
Svetlana is a wonderful professor, and I really enjoyed this class. Even when she had to take a few weeks off for a medical procedure, she made sure we have very interesting professors to teach each week, and it was awesome to see the other professors' points of view as well! I loved the mix of grad students and undergrads in this course, because as an undergrad, I got to learn from a lot of really intelligent grad students in a very close-knit setting. She had all of us regularly present passages and our interpretations of them, and I ended up learning a lot from the other students as well! This class is great, and I am SO GLAD I took it!
