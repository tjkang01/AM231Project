The workload is quite high, but class discussions are excellent and if you prepare well, your preparation is rewarded. Feedback on written work is also extremely good.
This class delivers exactly what it should: knowledge of the Czech interwar period and all the various art movements that sprang up and crumbled in that time. It's a survey, in a way, but it is still incredibly in-depth, and the professor is fantastic.
This class was my favorite this semester. I learned so much. I looked forward to going to class because I couldn't wait to discuss our readings with the other students in the class who had such great things to add.
