My knowledge of the Polish language has expanded leaps and bounds since I began the course sequence with Slavic Da. I'm very thankful to Pani Baranczak for her help and efforts in making learning the mechanics of the language possible. Do take this course if you want to seriously improve your knowledge of the language.
This is a fantastic class.
