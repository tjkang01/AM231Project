Great class with a wonderful teacher!
Take it if you're interested in learning about Polish culture and getting a solid introduction to the language!
The pace was too slow for me, course book is old and chaotic in presentation of the grammar, but the instructor is great.
Learning a foreign language is always an adventure, and so islearning Polish. There is much more that one carries outof the course beyond the grammar, vocabulary, and speaking skills.Cultural, historical, literary, and culinary insights makethis course a really pleasurable learning experience.
ahemn.  i DO tell people about this class!  and a fellow classmate and myself plan to take the Harvard Polish society by storm next year!  :D
Really relaxed atmosphere combined with rigorous pedagogy.
if you want to learn polish, its great
a strong interest inthe language is a must
The instructors are excellent, and the course is a great way to practice Polish and learn the basics of grammar fairly quickly.
The teaching is excellent! I am always shocked by how much of class I remember. The second semester introduces a weekly writing component which is helpful in practicing the language. The one downside is only a single hour a week of specified conversation section. It's a really fun class and very welcoming environment but be prepared to work. The language is not easy.
