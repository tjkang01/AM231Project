I would tell students that this class would be a fascinating way to look at problems of identity and the self as expressed through language within the larger framework of contemporary Russian poets. Stephanie Sandler is a wonderful lecturer, and the class has inspired me to rethink my conception the function (and possible functions) of language, the function of art, and the self. This strain of thinking is therefore necessarily more philosophical, and I found that the philosophic texts we used as tools of interpretation for the poems were particularly helpful and interesting. This class not only sparked a renewed interest in contemporary Russian poets, but also focused my attention on why literature is so fascinating: for example, how poetry can be the mediator between language and the unspeakable--a language of its own which points at the "gap" between what we can say, what we wish we could say, and the varying shades which exist therein. We also looked at poetry as essentially a psychological process, one in which the poet uses language to create a map in which one association links to another (or purposely disrupts this chain). This class is a fascinating take on many important concepts important outside of the field of literature and yet integrates them seamlessly, with much focus and detail, to the poetic self-fashioning of 20th and 21st century Russian poets. This class has inspired me not only in my academic thinking, but in my other creative pursuits as well.
This course provides an excellent introduction to a number of the bright lights of 20th-century Russian poetry, including well-known canonical poets and lesser-known poets of the avant-garde, unofficial and contemporary periods. Stephanie Sandler is a kind, patient and sharply attentive Virgil in the often unfamiliar and daunting depths of twentieth-century Russian poetry.
