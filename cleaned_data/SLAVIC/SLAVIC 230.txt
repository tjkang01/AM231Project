you will have to work very hard, but it is worth it! you will read great texts (both primary and secondary) and learn so much: not just facts and general information, but self-discipline, language skills, analytical skills. and you will receive feedback that will not simply "explain the grade," but give you good advice on how to write better, think better and work more efficiently. it was my favorite course this semester
I cannot recommend this class highly enough.  The subject material did not immediately appeal to me, but Professor Bolton is such an inspiring educator, he made the material come alive.
