Dr. Buckler is an absolutely amazing professor. She is intelligent in a non-intimidating way, and she is very willing to alter requirements in the course to suit the interests of the students taking it. I recommend this course with great enthusiasm!
This class is a very good way to be introduced to Russian art throughout history.  It allows you to research many different topics of your choosing, in oder to get a better sense of the works and the aspects of the works, that interest you.  Coming in with no background was not really a problem, although maybe just to understand the contexts of each work before class meetings.  Professor Buckler, however, gives excellent background on topics in class, but sometimes it is helpful to know beforehand.
This is an excellent and enjoyable class that allows you to explore specific related topics of interest in a very supportive framework.
