it is a great course. puts symbolist poetry in the context of the time and a wealth of information on how to read and interpret it. so much ground is covered that everyone will surely find something that interests them. possibilities for further study are limitless. also, a great course for learning how to analyze poetry in general.
The course is rewarding as long as you possess a desire to push yourself beyond what grammar classes at Harvard have taught you. It's a lot of work if you're not very comfortable with the language, but it's doable.
don't take this course if you have never taken a Russian poetry class before. Although it is extremely useful either way... just don't expect a good grade.
