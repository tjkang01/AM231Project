Excellent materials, brings music, theatre, opera, ballet and performance art in relation to literature.
I would highly recommend this course to students interested in Russian cultural studies, and who want a class that's engaging, interesting, and fun. I truly enjoyed the course, and learned a lot from grad students and undergrads alike.

It's great if you are already interested and familiar with Russian studies, opera, theater, music or ballet, otherwise you'll probably be lost. It was also 80% grad students this year, which enforces my last point and may make a difference to you.
