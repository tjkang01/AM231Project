This course provided a purview of the Russian literary avant-garde of 1910-130 alongside the development of the Formalist school.
This class will change how you think about art, literature, and possibly, life. Oh, and Charlie Chaplin.
Prof. Khitrova is great to work with. She's very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. Taking the fut/formalist class is a fine way to get to know her and learn a lot about the formalists (and futurists, if that's your thing)
