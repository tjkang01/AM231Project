Loved all the readings, loved hearing the professor's thoughts on everything, really enjoyed even the literary theory we had to read in the beginning. I just wish there was time to get to all of the readings, even the paper was a lot of fun and having the proposal and draft due made it very manageable. Toma is super flexible with everything, the point is for your understanding, not for arbitrary assignments, so it felt like meaningful work was being produced. Super great discussions in class, even not having taken a Slavic course before, I got a lot out of it and never felt like I was holding back the class from more meaningful discussion. Definitely one of the best if not the best courses I've had here. This is probably the only class at Harvard I've done absolutely all the readings for (even the ones we didn't make it to on the syllabus), and happily did so.
It's a great opportunity to look in depth at a really specific topic. It's also a great lens for learning about slavic literature, and a really rich topic.
