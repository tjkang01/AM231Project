Professor Weir is incredibly knowledgeable and unbelievably enthusiastic about Tolstoy in general and this novel in particular.  If you can read Russian fairly fluently and are willing to put in the time to read 80-ish pages of Russian a week, this class is definitely worth your time.
This was without a doubt my favorite course this semester. Professor Weir has such passion for the subject and so much knowledge about Tolstoy in general and Anna Karenina specifically that discussions were always very insightful. The class was very discussion-based, and even though Professor Weir will always joke about talking too much, I felt there was a very even balance between hearing his ideas and getting to express ours. WONDERFUL course!
It's a laid-back course, a whole semester to read one of the greatest novels in world literature. The professor is fun and engaging.
