You will be reading a short novel every week and writing a one to three page paper on various topics.   There seems to be a dominance of Czech works.
It was awesome. Take it even if you aren't a slavic concentrator.
A lot of the writings we looked at were amazing and definitely worth reading.
Definitely take it if you have any interest in Russian/Slavic literature!  Not a ton of reading, and almost all of it is really interesting (doesn't feel like you're reading for a class).  While 2 hours seemed like a long time for the discussion sometimes, it did go by quickly and I always left feeling I had learned something new or had a handle on the book we were reading for the week.  Your ability to read analytically and write WILL improve after taking this class.
This class is great in introducing one to the spectrum of Slavic literature.  It also gives one the opportunity to improve one's writing in a small and welcoming setting.
This course was a nice, solid launch into the Slavic department.  I enjoyed that it drew on works from outside the canon, as it helped to broaden my familiarity with other slavic literary traditions and also meant that I got to read things I had never read before.  It is also nice to get to know the fellow sophomore concentrators, and to create a place to bounce ideas and interpretations off one another.
I think it is a great class.  I would just like to see some more readings in Russian.
It turns out Slavic Literature does not just mean Russia--take this course and find out how wonderful Czech, Polish, Lithuanian, Uzbek, South Korean, and Spanish literature can be. (Note: only real literature included.)
Daria is an absolutely amazing professor. This course is a phenomenal opportunity to learn from and discuss with her in a tutorial setting. The weekly reading is reasonable and always interesting.
You should be devoted to this area of study to appreciate fully this course
Good survey introduction to Slavic lit
