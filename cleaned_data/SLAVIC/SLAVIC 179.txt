If you know Polish and love when language surprises, astonishes, touches, resists, plays tricks on you, and sometimes overwhelms you (in other words, if you love poetry), you can't not take this class.
An amazing writer, whose work deserves to be better known and translated more. It is exciting and I honestly could not think of a better guide than Prof. Nizynska.
