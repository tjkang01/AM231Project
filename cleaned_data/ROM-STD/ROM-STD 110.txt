This class was great, and Professor Richman is great and so understanding. There were weeks where the course felt mildly disorganized and themes from the class (resistance and diaspora) that weren't very clearly or explicitly parsed out, but that was all made up for by the always-interesting films and texts we got the chance to read. I love every one of the films and was at least interested in all of the literary texts, and discussions were lowkey and fun. Professor Richman is so understanding and this was an incredible environment for me personally to get experience reading in French for the first time, though everyone else in the course was much more fluent than me and the reading was a big challenge.
If you enjoy small group discussions and fascinating literature, definitely take this class! Prof. Richman will guide you through the cultural, historical, and linguistic elements of each novel, and discussions will be very animated and enlightening. Do be motivated to do the readings carefully and be on top of the paper writing, because the class is driven mainly by discussion.
If you love this topic, absolutely take this class! I personally was taking the class for a concentration requirement and wasn't totally interested in the material we were reading (but I was interested in the general topic), so sometimes it took me extra long to get through the readings. Dr. Richman is a wonderful teacher and is so encouraging.
