The class, the concept behind it, is extremely relevant. The final project was probably the most rewarding work I produced this semester. But I would like to see a different set up for the class periods. It was an introduction to a lot, the classes were based on discussion, but the students weren't yet well versed enough on the topics to have meaningful discussions, in my opinion.
This is the class to take if there is something you have always wanted to try but haven't had a reason to do it.
be project-driven and think about project ideas early on!
Digital Humanities is an important new direction in humanistic research, and this course makes an excellent case for why it matters, and provides a useful map for orienting yourself in these new methodologies. In privileging openness and collaboration, this course is very loosely structured. Students with lots of independent drive, curiosity and an entrepreneurial spirit will benefit the most from the style of the course.
This is a great space to follow personal ideas and projects with support from effective, enthusiastic, and supportive faculty.  Jeffrey has done great work and is clearly intent on helping his students accomplish the same.
