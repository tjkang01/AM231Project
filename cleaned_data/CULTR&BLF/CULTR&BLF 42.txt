This course has a LOT of readings, but it's worth it.
I loved this course! The readings were a bit long sometimes, but they were very interesting, so that made it easier to get through them. The teaching staff is so fun and passionate about what they teach which made the course all the better. Other than the readings, the workload is very light and the film screenings are a fun way to learn concepts.
Excellent class if you are interested in communist history and culture. The readings are all fantastic, particularly the novels. Probably not worth taking if you don't plan on doing the readings, because there are probably  easier Gen Eds to take, but if you are interested I highly recommend. Small class size this semester also made for great discussions. Only complaint would be that Professor Bolton's lecture style is very dry, but the content is excellent so if you stay alert they are one of the best components of the class.
I really enjoyed taking this course! The topic might seem niche for a Gen Ed, but I found a lot of the readings to be widely applicable and very interesting. This class also offers a great opportunity to learn a little bit about film (in the context of the Czech New Wave) without the pressure or expected prior knowledge of a VES class. If you have any interest in Communism and dissidence, it's a great class that views dissent through art, music, film, and writing.
A great way to get acquainted with twentieth-century Czech culture as it has shaped and been shaped by politics. A fair amount of reading (and with films on top of it, it does add up), but expect lectures that are not always incredibly dynamic/engaging.
