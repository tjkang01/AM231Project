do the readings and attending lectures is helpful.
While this course is interesting and the readings are phenomenal, I might recommend a seminar with the same professor as lectures are not her strong point.
Do the readings-- they are the best part of the course.
Lectures are not great, but the material is good, if too much work.
The course seemed a bit disorganized and the reading requirement was unrealistically large. The subject matter is fascinating and very applicable to today's world.
Really interesting and important material. Crucial to understanding the world today. Do the readings, they are worth it. And go to the film screenings
You will learn to think more clearly about really important issues for our day and age. Take this course - you will come out of it with a great knowledge of gender and Islam, and much more mature opinions.
The material is interesting and can facilitate good discussion in section. However, the lectures in class can devolve into tangents and can seem unstructured.
There's a TON of content, and if you can't keep yourself organized it's tough to keep up with all the reading and assignments. But it's an incredibly important topic and a really interesting part of the world to study.  Plus there's a great mix
this course is great because it changes how you think about the world.
The material covered in the class is very interesting, but there is a ton a reading and a lot of assignments. Be prepared to do a lot of reading or split the reading with someone else. Lectures can sometimes be a bit dry, but section is pretty good.
While not as flexible as other courses, it definitely delves in depth into the information that it does cover.
If you want your stereotypical understandings of gender, Islam, and the Middle East to be challenged and changed for the better, then I recommend this course for you.
It's great!
