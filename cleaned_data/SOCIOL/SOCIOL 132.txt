Lots of reading that is not necessary as everything is covered in class.
Very interesting course with very manageable work load! Prof Moon is very kind and knowledgable and willing to work with you.
I wish this class with Prof. Moon was being offered again because I've told a lot of my friends about it and they all want to take it. It was my favorite class this semester, by far.
