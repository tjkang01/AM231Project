Great place to get your bearings for the semester!
Make sure you supplement this class with other resources to help you with your first semester of teaching. The class in and of itself is unlikely to truly prepare you for all the challenges of teaching. Consider setting up one-on-one meetings with key faculty members and current/former TFs. Also, looking into the Bok Center's resources and building an informal small support group that meets periodically could be helpful.
In the first two or three weeks of this course, you can have essential knowledge about teaching Harvard undergrads under your belt.
