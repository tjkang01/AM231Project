This course has been an amazing experience. Even if you're only remotely interested in cultural sociology, I'd highly recommend you take it.
Keep in mind that you have to complete a research project at the end of the semester--a lot more work than you may anticipated.
Definitely take this class! This is the best class I have taken at Harvard.
