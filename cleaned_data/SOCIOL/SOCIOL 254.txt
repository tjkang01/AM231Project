It's great
This will be one of the best classes you take in graduate school. If you care about urban poverty, this class will also introduce you to a motivated and insightful cohort of potential collaborators.
Great course! Wilson is intimidating, but he takes the course extremely seriously.  He is the only senior professor that I've had who actually prepares carefully for courses!

This was an incredible course. I've never been in a class dealing with race where both minority and non-minority students are encouraged to speak with equal authority on these issues. Bill did a great job empowering everyone to share their opinion and ideas.
This is an incredible learning experience, but it is time intensive. Be sure you have the bandwidth to invest a substantial amount of time and energy in the course.
There is a lot to read and an assignment every week, but it's totally worth the effort! You get back 10X what you give.
There's nothing like taking a class with the experts (professors AND students).
By far the best class I have taken at Harvard for a few reasons:1. Wilson is a bona fide genius and it comes across clearly2. The mix of students (undegrads, PhDs, MPPs, among others) makes the course so much better3. The reading list is phenomenal4. The response paper format is exciting and thrilling
