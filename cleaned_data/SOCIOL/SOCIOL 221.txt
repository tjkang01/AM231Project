A must if interested in migration, even if not enrolled in the sociology department.
The course is eclectic and one gets an opportunity to build relationships with others interested in immigration.
This is a great course! Prof. Waters creates an environment of in-depth engagement with the course materials, and creates a high-participatory environment for students
Fantastic class! Had students from different schools, so a lot of different viewpoints were brought to the table. Professor Waters is great!
This course will open your eyes to an incredibly important, emergent subfield; the reading list is fantastic, the instructor is at the top of the field.
To me, it really only makes sense to take if you are very very interested in immigrant assimilation.  I did not think it was particularly helpful for thinking about other aspects of immigration research.
good sampling of assimilation/immigration/integration literature; good opportunities to discuss
This class focuses mainly on assimilation theory and integration. It deals less with immigration policy and focuses on the groups of interest in the current immigration literature (e.g., Mexican, Arab, West Indian, etc.). If your interest in immigrations is more directed towards those topics and populations, this class provides a nice overview of the current literature.
