I would highly recommend this class to anyone thinking of taking it because it comes with a year of funding.
Great to be forced to work on the proseminar paper, but I don't know how much I got out of class meetings other than just some interesting discussions
Great class, great community, important material, helpful for producing a paper
You get what you put into this course.  It's a great opportunity for those interested in multidisciplinary research on inequality.
It is extremely valuable to get to know grad students in other departments who share your substantive interests. This course is an excellent way to do that.
Be prepared for a lot of reading from Bobo but the reading is excellent. Be prepared for SLOGS of economic reading from Deming, which isn't as interesting or important.
