This course was great! Alvaro is very friendly and funny. The readings were interesting. The final paper was very unstructured and allowed for all sorts of different interests. The classroom environment was low-pressure. All around a great class.
Great junior tutorial! Alvaro is fantastic!
Alvaro is great and you will learn a lot about conducting a research project
