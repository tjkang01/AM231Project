Pretty good - can be a little repetitive. I wish the class were a little bit more lecture-focused rather than discussion focused.
The course material is interesting. However, the best part of this class is getting to learn from Prof. Small. He will make you think and makes coming to class really enjoyable.
This was a great class. Professor Small is leading in his field and you learn a lot from him, not just from his lectures and his ideas but from his willingness to engage the class in discussion and push all ideas introduced. This class definitely requires work and you must be prepared for each class but it is well worth it.
This is an excellent introduction to network sociology. Prof. Small is a leading scholar in the field, and he is also an excellent instructor.
It's a pretty good class but it would be better with a bit more structure/guidance. Too often it ended up just being students talking on and on saying generalized BS without having done the reading carefully.
