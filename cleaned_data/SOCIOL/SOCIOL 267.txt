Even if you don't intend to 'be' a political sociologist, this is very helpful if you intend to study policy questions
I would highly recommend it -- it teaches a side/view of political science that is neglected in the gov department.
Coming from a political science background, the course filled in many important gaps. I feel much better prepared to analyze political dynamics at all levels.
A great opportunity to understand the sociological processes behind politics that is not provided in the government department.
The material is immense, but Dr. Bonikowski is fantastic in giving a reasonably comprehensive review of the field.
Class provides foundational knowledge of political sociology theories with a great professor who cares about students' interests
The material is very interesting and the professor is excellent.
This course serves as an excellent introduction to the interesting subfields of political sociology. In addition to reviewing the best pieces in the field, class discussions can provide inspiration for future research.
