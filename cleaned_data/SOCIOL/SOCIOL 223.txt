If you're interested in American social policy, this class will introduce you to current research horizons in an array of important areas.
The reading list and topic were great, but I regret taking this course.  We have precious few opportunities to do coursework in grad school, and I feel I squandered one such slot on this class.  Neither Theda or Mary put time or effort into teaching this semester.
I do not recommend this course at all. The course readings are very lengthy and require a substantial amount of work. The class is set up to be a seminar style, in which participation is required. However, the in-class experience is run much like a lecture, where one person dominates the class. While a part of your grade is based on participation, it is very difficult to participate because you are constantly interrupted and cut-off. If your are able to finish your comments--no matter how intelligent and relevant they are--you will be cut down immediately by one of the professors. This has very detrimental effects on in-class discussion and participation. There is a clear line between constructive criticism and criticism. Again, the one dominating professor voices her opinion against almost anything that is said.
