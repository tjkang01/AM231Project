Material gets repetitive, and although the topic is interesting, class discussion was painfully boring.
Be prepared for an extremely heavy reading load in this class.  While I understand that for some classes, a book a week, can be helpful to orient students with the materials.  I honestly felt that since this was an introductory course, more targeted readings, like journal articles or book chapters, would have been more helpful.
This is the best class I've ever taken at Harvard. Professor Herzog is awesome - very likable and knowledgeable about the subject. Readings are awesome and easy - theory is interesting. But what makes this class awesome, is at the end of the class - you'll be able to answer questions such as : what should the US do about its immigration policy? should we extend citizenship to everyone? In short, this course is incredible ! TAKE IT.
