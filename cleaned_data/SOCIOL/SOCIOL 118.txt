Easy class, interesting readings but poor discussions and lectures. People didn't really do the readings and just said vague opinions about why certain countries shouldn't get foreign aid or why the government doesn't actually have a role in alleviating poverty. Not very difficult this year but the professor is leaving so it could be totally different in a future year. Topic is interesting and with a new professor has a lot of potential.
He is a fantastic teacher
You will learn a lot with the readings, but there are so many different ideas presented that it is difficult to come out with very deep knowledge by just doing coursework. You'll get what you put into it.
This is an interesting class that, for the most part, confirmed what I already knew or believed or guessed. I wish the class had more diversity of opinion as I was the only one who wasn't a liberal and looked at some issues with costs and benefits in mind. The readings were great, and I am sad to say that Prof. Eskici won't be teaching this class next year. He was an effective lecturer and a fascinating person to talk to.
Great class with wonderful reading but I wish we went more in-depth.
Great class to take if you are interested in international development. Burak covers many many theories and is also very engaging and fun to talk to in class.
