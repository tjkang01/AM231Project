A small seminar with a lot of reading which is mostly discussion-based. There is a lot of flexibility in the class, and you learn a decent bit about theories of nationalism. Likely to appeal to people interested in political science. Recommended for seniors doing theses.
A good survey course on nationalism that will expose you to relevant texts and topics.  Also will allow you to engage with your own interests within the context of what you learn.  A great class.
This class has very clear expectations. It is one book a week and a two hour conversation. I felt  students who put a lot into the class came away with a lot.
