I think important themes are covered in this class, one that is fundamental if you are interested in gender studies. The content is broad too, and I felt a lot was covered in just one semester and left with more knowledge, and I am really glad I took this class for that reason.
This class is SO interesting and important! Definitely worth taking!
Especially if you haven't thought about women's issues or workplace gender dynamics much, this is a fantastic course (and even if you have, it still is). Readings are short enough to keep your attention and are very interesting and relevant; class discussion moved at a good pace and I was rarely bored. There are only three writing assignments, the first two of which combine to form the first half of the third, which is a final paper; at least in our iteration of the course, the final paper was basically an opportunity to analyze qualitative research and write it up, similarly to what you would do for a thesis, and it was a FANTASTIC way to learn more about sociological method and to think really critically about the themes covered in the courses. One of my favorite classes at Harvard so far!!!
