Be sure to push your research project as far as possible before taking the class to ensure you get the most valuable feedback. Also track detailed notes from the feedback you receive -- both from the instructor and from the class.
Great professor, very helpful
That the linear model of research which guides the class is out of line with actual research processes, that it can be counter-productive to actually DOING one's research, and that if they do qualitative researcher to heavily augment this course with classes that speak to the unique issues which they face.
This is a great course to get feedbacks for your QP.
Work hard to have a full draft of your QP ready by the time this class starts. You will get more out of the class if you have a full, complete draft.
