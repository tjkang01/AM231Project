This class provides great insight into the inequalities present within workplaces. Take this if you are prepared to commit to the coursework and class.
The material in this course is very engaging, and Professor Brinton is a dedicated professor.
its a depressing course, and not a lot of discussion is focused on what can be done to help the situation.
