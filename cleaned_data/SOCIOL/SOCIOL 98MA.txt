This course was awesome, it's a highly recommended tutorial. What's so cool about urban sociology is that you can study it right here in Cambridge, in Boston, etc. It opens your eyes to the social issues that cities face. The readings are all super interesting too. Professor Rosen is a super thoughtful and engaged professor. It's clear she really cares that her students are learning and are thinking deeply about these issues. What's nice though is that she is also super laid-back and approachable, so getting help/receiving feedback is not intimidating at all. Overall I really enjoyed the class.
Professor Rosen made my junior tutorial an amazing experience. She was very hands-on and helped me develop/edit my research question, and she is flexible about meeting outside of class. Recommend this course and this professor!!
