This is an incredible class. The subject matter is unparalleled to anything offered at Harvard. You will really learn a lot about the world of international development and become an optimistic skeptic about the practices and theories out there. However, if you like seeing feedback and learning how to grow, this may not be for you. Professor Viterna is incredible, but she is also incredibly busy and sometimes that made it a little difficult to meet with her.
Professor Viterna is AMAZING.  She is so interested in the things we discuss and open to new ideas and view points.   I came into this tutorial not knowing/caring about the subject, and I left LOVING it. The readings are interesting and modern.  TAKE THIS CLASS.
This course was amazing. I wasn't even particularly interested in the subject matter when I started, but the professor really generated enthusiasm for the subject. I took it because I wanted to really see sociological theory in practice and it's relation to real world events and it was great for that.
First time the course was offered, so it had some bugs that I imagine will be worked out.
Great course material and good introduction to development, but was a bit unorganized at times. The professor was great in class, but sometimes hard to reach outside of class.
