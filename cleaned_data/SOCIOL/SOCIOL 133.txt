This course is filled with incredibly thought-provoking and engaging topics--the lectures are delivered passionately, and the readings themselves will challenge so many of your assumptions. That said, if you plan on doing none of the readings, Professor Mandic will make life quite difficult for you.
Be prepared to go the extra mile. This is a lecture course with only two assignments, but the readings are incredibly rich and Professor Mandic is eager to talk ideas, course concepts, and anything else even tangentially related.
This is pretty interesting material about how revolution/war/organized . Professor Mandic requires participation, read the material, and there's a pretty strict attendance policy. The weekly readings were pretty long and the lectures relate directly to the readings.  Overall pretty minimal work though and if you try even slightly move than average, you'll be rewarded. Definitely recommend as a great balance class.
This class had a very interesting approach to many social phenomenon. The readings were fantastic and the assignments were very open ended for your own benefit. If you're willing to do the readings (they are often lengthy), you will learn a lot!
The course is full with interesting information regarding war and war themes.
