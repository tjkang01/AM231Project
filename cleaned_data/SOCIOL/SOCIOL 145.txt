If you are interested in higher education and would like an opportunity to reflect on your own and others' experience at college, definitely take this course! There are no others like it. It was such an enriching experience.
Manja is incredible! She truly cares about her students and about the course she is teaching it. If she is teaching a class, I highly recommend you take it. The readings were very interesting, and we also did a lot of field work (interviewed people). There were only 4 people in the class, so I always felt like we were a little family. And Manja is able to create a fun, engaging and informative course.
