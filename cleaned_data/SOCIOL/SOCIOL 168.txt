Professor Good is one of the nicest professors I've ever had at Harvard and knows her material extremely well. But this course was so disorganized and haphazard that I'm not entirely sure what all I'm supposed to get out of it. Each week was fun but also kind of a Pandora's Box. We were never sure what we were going to get.
The course material is quite interesting, and Professor Good has a lot of knowledge and experience in the field of global health. Be ready to discuss the readings in class, even if you are not sure what readings were to be done. The only concern to note is that this class is very free-flowing and lacks a bit of structure, so it kind of gets difficult to know what to read or what to do in preparation for the class.
It was a really great class - we learned a lot, although it was a bit disorganized.
MJ is a gem! This course really changes your perspective on hum aid!
Very interesting class about global health, seminar style is nice to discuss readings (can still get by without doing all the readings), overall fairly relaxing and cool class. Professor Good has amazing experiences in global health as well!
