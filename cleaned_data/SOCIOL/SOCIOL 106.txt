Really solid course! Professor Dromi walks through the foundations of humanitarian activism and also through assignments grants a lot of opportunities for self-learning and investigation into modern-day humanitarian crises!
I learned so much about the Humanitarian sector including the issues that can arise from foreign involvement in humanitarian crises. It gave me a very real understanding of these organizations and how they aren't perfect as they sometimes appear to be.
This class is a gem, but you should definitely be interested in the topic to make it worth taking.
course is very easy overall. some of the assignments can be hard. I especially struggled with the final paper, which can be difficult if you're not that interested in the topic you chose. overall, good class, Professor Dromi is suuuuper helpful and accessible to students, and the materials are pretty interesting. definitely take the class if you're interested in learning more about humanitarian activism and its benefits and consequences.
