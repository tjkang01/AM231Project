The class provides a forum to discuss ethical issues we face as scientists but does not adequately provide students with the tools to handle these issues.
NA this is required, Who cares if I recommend this. This question doesn't make sense.
You have to take it...
It's relatively inconvenient to have to take this course in our G5 years but we have no choice! How valuable the experience will be will likely depend on who is in your discussion group.
It's a requirement. Swallow hard and get it done.
I was annoyed to be required to take it, but the instructors made it entertaining.  I enjoyed the discussion section.
I would recommend students to sign up in a small group with a friend or two. Because members of our small group knew one another we were more honest and engaged in our discussions, so we got much more out of it than if we were going through the motions  (which may be more likely with strangers).
It's required, but not too much effort.
It's a large waste of time.
It's not too bad.
It's required, so you have to do it. The small group discussions are interesting.
An easy and enjoyable way to to get you thinking about extremely important topics and ethical issues you will surely encounter working in biomedical science! Discussions, such as ones had in this class, should be held regularly among colleagues, and this class is a great starting point.
