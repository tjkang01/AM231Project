A great way to get exposed to a variety of interesting careers for graduate students
This course will force you to explore yourself and allows you to judge based on your own personality what might be a good career for you. You are exposed to alumni from a variety of career paths.
Definitely worth taking even if you think you know what you want to do after grad school.
This is a great course to give you access to different career paths over a short period of time. Since the class is smaller, it makes it much easier to ask questions and interact with the panelists in the networking session.
Fantastic career exploration resource
