The lecturers are interesting, it is an immersion course, learn a lot in a short period of time, the reading-load isn't too high.
As with many classes, you will get out of this class what you put in, so be sure to read the papers before class thoroughly.
My favorite course of the semester. Really provides a strong overview of the interactions of the immune system with tumors and how these interactions are being exploited for therapeutic benefits.
The topics covered in this class are very well put together, and you will definitely learn a lot from this course.
Great course for learning about tumor immunology. Requires significant preparation for each class in the form of reading papers.
