I would say that this course is a great intro to Aramaic taught by a great professor who brings enthusiasm into the class!
The atmosphere in the class maintained by the teacher is very welcoming and helpful.
Be prepared to go through a huge rush of grammar at the beginning, but it gets better.
A great introduction to Ancient Aramaic. Most of the focus is on reading primary sources.
This class is an excellent way to learn Aramaic and read as much Biblical and Imperial Aramaic as possible. It helps to have competent Hebrew first.
