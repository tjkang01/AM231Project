beware - writing the reports may be a galling experience
I would recommend graduate students to take the course early, either 1st or 2nd year, as it gives them a good feel about experimental work and also the writing component (using Latex) is an good experience for the future.
One of the best lab courses I've taken
The experiments are a lot of fun to do, and the teaching staff is excellent! You get a lot of feedback, and learn many hands-on experimental techniques, and enhance your knowledge of fundamental physics. The course takes a lot of time (writing papers + learning the material associated with your experiment + the experiment itself). It's definitely worth it!
The course will likely take more work than you would expect, but would ultimately be a rewarding experience.
It takes a lot of time but it's worth taking the course.
Time management is key
