Take this course if it is ever offered again.
This course is fantastic in principle, covering a lot of key and useful material - however it is executed rather poorly, with opaque lectures and problem sets and a vague final assignment.
This is an excellent course on conformal field theory. Most of the course focuses on two dimensional CFT, but there are also several lectures on CFT in higher dimensions, as well as on recent research trends like the conformal bootstrap. The workload is manageable and you will learn a lot.
This is one of the best advanced physics courses at Harvard. It is not offered often, so make sure you take it when it is available. Xi is a great teacher. Assignments are also quite amazing. They are quite difficult, but you learn a lot while doing them.
That it is a challenging class but it is very interesting and you would learn a lot. It would be better to take it in a semester where you can give enough time to it.
