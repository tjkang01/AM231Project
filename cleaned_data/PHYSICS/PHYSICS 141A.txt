great class; the learning to work ratio is high; it is interesting to see how the math/statistics/physics/computer science apply to biological questions. the teaching staff this year were all very good and the problem sets were quite interesting. some of the psets require a good deal of coding though.
Physics 141a is the same course as AM 126. It is a broad overview of major statistical inference topics with applications to biology: parameter estimation, model selection, information optimization, pattern recognition, hidden Markov models, non-parametric methods, and PCA. Lectures and sections are fairly relaxed, and the workload is very manageable. You can spend only a little time on this course and get out only a little, or a lot of time and get out a lot -- it's really up to you.
