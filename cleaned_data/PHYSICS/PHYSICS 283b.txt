It's interesting, and it's lectures form a most enjoyable break during the other daily work.
It is difficult to judge the nature of the class, as this was the first time it has been offered.  The content was interesting but the class organization was fairly non-existent.  This class has great potential, but consult with course instructors before taking it to make sure that they've ironed out some of the wrinkles.
