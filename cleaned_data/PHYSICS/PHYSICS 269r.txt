You will learn a lot of useful mathematical techniques and applications of statistical mechanics. The course covers many areas of biophysics, some of which are more interesting than others. If one has absolutely no interest in biology or chemistry, I would not suggest this course.
A great overview of biophysical topics, perfect for those who like applications of statistical mechanics.
Do not take any other class during the same term!
The course was an excellent and interesting survey of biological physics.  I enjoyed seeing stat mech concepts applied in novel (for me) systems.
Nice introduction to diverse topics; not difficult compared with other physics classes.
Very interesting course!
You'll get a lot of interesting knowledge! Strongly recommend!
This course can be quite useful from a variety of perspectives. For example, I took it as an introduction to physical biology and found it very satisfying and interesting.
This class is particularly useful for graduate students who are enthusiastic about entering biology from a quantitative perspective. It will be particularly useful for people who want to answer theoretical questions in biology
Perhaps a bit too physics-y but a great intro to how statistical physics can be used to address problems in Biology as well as understanding Statistical Mechanics in Biological Systems.
This class is really interesting and changed/improved how I think of biology. It will give you the foundation to understand a wide range of biophysical problem. Also, Prof. Nelson is a charming, considerate, and engaging lecturer.
