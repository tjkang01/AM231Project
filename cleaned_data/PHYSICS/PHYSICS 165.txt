Interesting material, well taught, might watch out for midterm/final structure in future years as it may change.
Atomic physics is awesome! And this course is a great way to learn the challenging field as an undergraduate.
A really fun class with loads of interesting material. Reminded me why I wanted to study physics.
This class is superbly taught and presents very interesting physics, focusing on deep, underlying principles. It may not be applicable to all fields, but I think for those considering grad school and uncertain of their potential field, this is a perfect way to see if you like AMO. And after this course, you probably will.
This was definitely the best class I've taken in 4 years at Harvard.  It was difficult enough to be really interesting but moved at a pace that made sure that everyone kept up, it was extremely well-taught, the problem sets genuinely helped to make the material understandable, and the midterm and final oral exam were fair and accurate assessments of what you had learned.  I enjoyed going to every class and doing the problem sets.
This class was my first exposure to physics beyond the standard 15, 143 sequence. It was a great way to see interesting applications of what I had learned previously, and was in general just a fun way to spend an hour and a half every Tuesday and Thursday.
