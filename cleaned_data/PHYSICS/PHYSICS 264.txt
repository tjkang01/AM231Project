The theory of Lie algebras is beautiful. This course covers up to the classification theorem of Lie algebras, focusing on SU(n) because that is what physics cares about. As a general rule in this course, the more you rely on Mathematica, the less you understand the material (I relied heavily on Mathematica). As a general rule for all courses and especially this one, try to read the material before lecture and ask plenty of questions. Georgi is great (and invented SU(5)).
This is a HARD class. It will take a lot of time. You will probably get a good grade, but to really get everything you can out of this course you need to put in the hours. Don't miss class, and do everything you can to not fall behind.
Challenging course. Be prepared to work hard.
This is one of the very best classes I have ever taken. I walked away with a truly intuitive understanding of Lie algebras and their applications in particle physics. We construct some really cool results in this class just from math and it's pretty neat to reserve some of Gell-Mann's most important historical results. This class is fantastic!
