If you're interested in pursuing work in condensed matter theory or experiment you should really consider taking this course.
It is far better to audit this course rather than to take it seriously for credit.
In this class you can learn more about physical picture rather than sophisticated techniques.
A very difficult course, but usually interesting and definitely useful, especially if it's in your area of research.
Given the emphasis on advanced topics, this course is really aimed at those already familiar with many body theory who want their knowledge solidified with an introduction to advanced topics.
Take this course if you have a good grasp of many-body quantum mechanics and field theoretic techniques. Otherwise (as was my case) it often becomes difficult to follow the physics as the course proceeds at a really fast pace (according to me). This course will be extremely useful if you want to know about reasonably recent research topics in quantum condensed matter physics.
If Sachdev is teaching it, take it!
Ask the instructor about the REAL prerequisits which are based on the ACTUAL syllabus he plans to use.
