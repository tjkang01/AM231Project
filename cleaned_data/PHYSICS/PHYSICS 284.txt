A nice introduction to topics of current research. May be a bit incoherent at times but you can get a lot out of it.
Lots of useful material but very difficult.
It's a great class. Eugene does an excellent job at presenting concepts with lots of physical motivation and minimal sophisticated maths, and also drawing connections with recent experiments. Strongly recommended if you want to do AMO/CMT.
Take the class. It's easy and doesn't require that much effort, but you can learn a fair amount if you put in the effort.
This is a very relevant course if you are studying in atomic physics or condensed matter physics. It covers a lot of current cold atom research, and relate them to condensed matter physics.
This course covers many interesting topics relevant to current research, but the course needs to be improved.  The homeworks do not prepare the student, and the class notes are far from complete or informative.
Start solving the problem sets far before the deadline, it takes more than 1 day.
Very hard but very useful.
don't let yourself fall behind, you will never catch back up.
Be sure you're very interested in the material; it's difficult, and thus hard to stay motivated if you're not too interested.
Good introduction for ultracold atoms. Also useful for experimentalists.
