A whirlwind tour of supersymmetry, this course covers a truly impressive volume of the modern QFT landscape, and provides invaluable tools for solving problems in all walks of theoretical physics.
Excellent course, mainly focused on supersymmetry. Girma is such an enthusiastic lecturer.
Be sure you are willing to independently seek out external references to really get something out of this class.
interesting exposure to a large number of ideas in progressing past the standard model
The lecturer is an expert in the field and so it's well worth going to this course if you want to specialize in high energy physics.
One should do the reading, because the course might not be as structured as one would like.
This is a great class taught by an expert in the field. Very interesting and enriching.
This course covers a number of advanced topics in particle physics and in my opinion provides an excellent preparation to understanding current research in particle physics phenomenology.
