This course is good and one learns a lot, but it requires a lot of work. There is no text and a lot of reading outside class needs to be done.
String theory gets more and more interesting as you go deeper into it (in my opinion): if you've taken the earlier courses, it's well worth taking the third one.
This is a course on advanced topics in string theory. Problem sets are time consuming but rewarding. The lectures are clear and Professor Yin does an excellent job teaching the material.
This is a very difficult class but covers a good range of important topics in the field.
This is a wonderful course and Professor Yin is an excellent and clear lecturer. The problem sets are very hard, but very valuable and interesting.
If you want to do research in high-energy theory there is no substitute for this class.
The homework for this course may occupy the majority of your time, but the reward in the end is far worth it.
If they have the appropriate background, this is an excellent course to deepen technical skills and conceptual understanding of relevant physical principles.
Prepare to spend a lot of time on this course.
Teaching string theory well is hard. This course does a reasonably good job, with problems that could be easily corrected.
It's very difficult and very fast and requires a lot of work.
