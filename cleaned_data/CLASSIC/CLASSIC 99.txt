Be prepared to adapt and change directions relatively late in the process.
Start spending a lot of time on your thesis at the very beginning of the fall semester, because time goes by very quickly at first, and the work piles up. Getting a jump on reading secondary literature early in the fall is particularly helpful.
don't expect your advisor will advise you or even be open to listening to your ideas.  rather, think of him/her as your criticizer.
