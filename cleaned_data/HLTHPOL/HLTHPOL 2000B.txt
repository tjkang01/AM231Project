Learn how to read strategically.
At the beginning of the semester everyone in the class should divide up the readings and compile them. Also helpful to do that for taking notes on all the readings.
Enjoy the time hearing from faculty!  Try not to worry about grades.  (In our year, they tended to be pretty low.)
