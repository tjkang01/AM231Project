It's a really fun class with fascinating content.  The workload is very manageable.  Professor Innes is a very engaging teacher, an interesting lecturer, and is good at facilitating discussion.  I learned a lot in this class and I wish I could take another class about Finn.
The Finn Cycle is a fascinating literary tradition stretching across many centuries, and this course is a great way to explore that tradition through source texts in translation.
