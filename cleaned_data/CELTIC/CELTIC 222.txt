This class is very informative and interesting, even if you aren't a Celtic studies student. You even get to learn about sixteenth-century Irish pirates and their role in the manuscript culture of the time!
A great class!  I bet the next iteration will be even better!
This course is beautiful! You'll have the chance to sit down with some of the most interesting and inspiring exampples of the human desire to create and to share. You'll also get to work with a professor who brings buckets of enthusiasm to the material and gives his all to the course and the students.
This course is a great one to take if you're interested in medieval manuscripts and the history of book production. The workload is very reasonable and the material is fascinating. You also get hands-on practice with transcription.
Manuscripts are the key to understanding literary transmission, and if you don't know them, then you can't know the literary tradition.  So learn paleography.
