Whether this is your fourth Celtic course or your first, and no matter what your concentration, this class will be an enjoyable exploration into a topic we all relate to: food, and how it features in one particular culture. You get a lot out of Celt120 for pretty low effort: workwise, the course is very chill. At the same time, though, I came to lecture and section each day feeling so excited and left with information that will stay with me. Professor Nagy and the TF Patrick are absolutely wonderful. Take this class!!!!
Most courses in the Celtic Department are excellent, but Food & Fantasy is a true gem - although this was only the first year it was taught, the course was very well-organized, well-taught, and just fascinating overall. The enthusiasm and expertise of the professor (and teaching staff) makes lecture genuinely engaging, and the material itself is so interesting! Highly recommend, even if you don't have any previous background or experience.
This course was a fantastic way to learn more about Irish culture through the lens of food.  It had a really good mix of looking at the historical realities of food over the course of Irish history and looking at how food was presented in Irish literature.  It was really enjoyable and not too stressful.  I would definitely recommend it!
This class is great! The readings are all interesting and using a lens of food studies provides a whole new way of reading analytically. The food that gets brought into class just makes things even better!
This course is a fascinating introduction to the scholarly study of food and its role in culture, folklore, history, etc. You can definitely apply the ideas and concepts we studied to other cultures as well, but it's great to get the focus on Ireland and see how the role of food both changes and remains constant from medieval literature to modern stories. It's a very fun course, and professor Nagy sometimes provided food related to specific stories we were studying.
