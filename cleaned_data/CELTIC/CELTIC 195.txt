Take it! But not too many of you. Or else they may run out of tea.
Great course! Sm is fantastic!
Sm is wonderful and will get you interested in the subject. The language can be difficult, but Sm knows what he's talking about and is very good at helping you through everything you do. He really trusts his students to get their work done when they can and this creates a very mature class environment. Discussion is free and interesting and the poetry is beautiful.
