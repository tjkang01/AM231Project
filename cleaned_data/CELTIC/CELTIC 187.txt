This course is a fantastic exploration into the Celtic world and Prof. Sumner does a phenomenal job of bringing the material to life.
It was a really enjoyable class with great course materials!
You will get a marvelous new angle on literary history if you haven't been thinking about Ireland before. You'll start to think about the social, political, and historical contexts of the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in such new and productive ways, and you'll love it.
This class is both fun and different while giving great insights on an entire culture and history just through a few specific genres of literature.
This class is so much fun, you should definitely take it if you're interested! Prof. Sumner is wonderful and the subject matter is really fascinating!
