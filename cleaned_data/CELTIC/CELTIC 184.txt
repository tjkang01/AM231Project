Prof.  Cathasaigh is one of the best professors at Harvard. Take any class of his! The Tin really allows you to closely work with him and gain immense insight into early Irish history and mythology.
You will learn a lot of new things about Irish literature and history but won't be overwhelmed with too much reading!
I would heartily recommend it. The course provides a comprehensive introduction to the Tain and its pre-tales, and it enables students to become familiar enough with the secondary literature so as to conduct further research in the field.
This class is a great way to learn the ins and outs of a great Irish epic!
Fantastic class! Prof O Cathasaigh is a very knowledgable and entertaining lecturer. Definitely recommended for anyone with an interest in Irish mythology.
Prof. O Cathasaigh is retiring this year, but I really hope they offer this course again in future. It was a spectacular finish to my Harvard career. The Tain gives an interesting perspective on people long since dead, but also on people today. Some things just don't change.
This is a delightful course and I would highly recommend it to anyone interested in mythology, folklore, or just strange and interesting stories.  Getting to focus on and close read the text of the Tain the whole semester is really rewarding, and professor O Cathasaigh is an incredible lecturer.
