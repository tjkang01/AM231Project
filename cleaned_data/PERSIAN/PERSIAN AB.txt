Do your homework diligently and write down everything Sheida says. Keeping an organized dictionary (especially of verbs) as you go is helpful too.
Sheyda and Paul are great, but the homework draws out for hours upon hours, and it won't feel like anything besides rudimentary level homework. Later assignments, like movie reviews, would be more immersive and rewarding, but the majority of the semester is systematic lumbering.
This is a great class and Professor Dayani is very willing to push students if they are looking for more challenging material.
