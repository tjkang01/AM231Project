I would highly recommend this course to someone who already knows a good deal of Persian. This class was very interesting and it taught me a lot about poetry (not just Persian poetry). The course material is interesting and chosen well. The assignments were straightforward and I learned a great deal about reading and dissecting a poem or a piece of literature and writing about it. Professor Landau is phenomenal and she really cares about each student. She gives great feedback on your work and she makes sure to answer all of your questions. I've never seen a professor be this accommodating to students ever!
