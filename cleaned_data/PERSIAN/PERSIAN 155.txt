The Professor is first class. She has very thorough knowledge. And she also devotes hours of time to evaluating and commenting on student work. I have never received such detailed feedback on my work before taking this class. I really like the Professor - it was a great choice for Harvard to bring them here. I hope she stays here for the long haul and can teach more courses. The professor made this course successful and steller. Kudos to her.
Seize the chance to work with Professor Landau! She is one of the rare professors who truly cares about her students and gives amazingly detailed feedback on each and every one of your written assignments. She is very generous, too generous, with her time, and will sit with you to go through line by line any text that you have trouble reading. In addition, she is also great to talk to about your general dissertation project, regardless of discipline. She is a great listener, and always gives insightful and perceptive comments that is essential in the preliminary years of any graduate student. For undergraduate students, you will absolutely enjoy her course material, she makes Classical Persian relevant to our lives today. I looked forward to every class meeting as one looks forward to a weekly reunion of friends who love to converse about literature, history, and life.
