Anyone who needs Persian must take this
If you are very interested in learning Persian specifically, take this class. If you just need to fill a language requirement, there are classes that are easier. Overall, I really liked it, but that is because I am interested in Persian.
Take this class only if you have a good reason or are passionate. It's not a class to take lightly or for fun.
You will need to be self-motivated and a little entrepreneurial about getting conversation practice.
Persian is a difficult by rewarding language. I think this course does a good job of helping students develop skills in listening, speaking, and writing, and builds on other skills in Persian.
Sheida is one of the best language instructors I have ever studied with! The course prepares one well for learning how to speak, read and comprehend modern Farsi.
That the course offers an excelent balance of basic level and intermediate as well as of standard written and colloquail Farsi.
If you are taking this class for fun (not for a requirement), I recommend you audit. Only because the grading is clear but also strict, and it'll likely bring down your GPA. If you have to take the course, fear not! Sheida is a brilliant professor and your Persian will definitely improve. She takes a modern innovative approach towards language teaching, which is a Godsend in a world where you can only study Persian through the poetry of Rumi and Hafez.
