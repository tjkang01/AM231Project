Only take this class if you are really passionate about Persian or have a strong reason for taking it. The class will help you read and write better but not improve your speaking skills too much.
It is literally your only option if you want to carry on learning Persian.
I loved this class. The professor is awesome, but he is leaving next year. That being said, Persian is a beautiful language, so definitely go for it
The Persian program at Harvard seems to remain in a state of flux, and until it is made a priority within the administration, cannot be recommended wholeheartedly. The faculty I have had are earnest, enthusiastic, and dedicated to the language and its instruction, but the youth of the instructors, the variation between instructors, and the lack of a sense of support from department admins (or higher) makes Persian a frustrating language track.
This is a very difficult course, but the language is fascinating and worth studying
It is not a very holistic approach to the language. If someone is interested in being able to read scholarly texts in Persian, then it would probably suit their goals better than someone who wanted to be able to speak the language and have daily interactions.
