If the course focus more on developing a paper, then I think it will be very useful.
Great course to take when you're just getting started trying to publish. Does a wonderful job showing you the ins and outs of the process, how things need to be packaged and presented. It was also so much fun being able to work with so many people on a single topic - a truly unique experience.
It has been helpful to start doing a bit of research and getting to know the research process and the department.
