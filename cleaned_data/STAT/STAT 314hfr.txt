I'd say that without taking the class, I would have had a very difficult time understanding the colloquia this semester. The class also introduced me to some topics in statistics that are not traditionally taught in the department. A great course that I'm planning on taking next semester too!
Colloquia talks can be boring and/or hard to follow if the speaker is not good, especially if they are about obscure or very technical area of statistics. This class (which meets usually an hour or two before the colloquium) is basically about reading a foundational paper in the subfield the talk is going to be about, and decipher it. That allowed me to get a lot out of the colloquia.
This is a good way to get exposure to a wide variety of current statistical research.
