Jun's philosophy and insights on statistics are awesome :) Go and learn.
Very good material if you are interested in MCMC on a theoretical level
It's a good class to learn a lot of interesting and relevant computing ideas, but perhaps getting Professor Liu's book is enough?  The presentations can be unclear, but I felt like I gained a lot of intuition and general understanding just from listening.
Make sure to read along in Prof Liu's book Monte Carlo Techniques in Scientific Computing as you cover topics in the course. They are all well-covered in the text.
