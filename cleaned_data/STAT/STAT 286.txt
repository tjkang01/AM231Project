Stat 286 is a new course, and I'm not sure if it will be taught in the future. If it is, I would strongly recommend it to students interested in  causal inference. The papers that we read were challenging, but it was rewarding to get through them. The final paper for the course is also a helpful experience, and students have freedom to apply the PS framework to their areas of interest.
Highly, highly, highly recommend this course if you're someone interested in causal inference and want to learn a new framework for addressing complications in randomized experiments or observational studies. Fabrizia is a great lecturer -- and the class format is great for learning the material in a discussion-type format along with other students from fields such as education, political science, and statistics!
