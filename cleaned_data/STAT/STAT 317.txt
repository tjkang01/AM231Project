Awesome class taught by experts
Great introduction to particle methods (SMC, PMCMC, etc...) with a good balance between applied, methodological, theoratical papers. I learned a lot from this class !
If you're interested in the current state of the art on particle methods, this is a great way to see the core of the literature.
