I did not learn anything in this class, which is ironic, considering it's about learning.
If you think of it as a 300-level seminar, it's good. Plan on doing a lot of reading, and hopefully it will be better organized next year.
Prepare to have a real taste of research.  Specially reading difficult papers with no or little background in the specific topic.
This is an extremely interesting class. Professor Airoldi is an expert on the field and the people that will be there, are likely to be equally interesting and interested to. However, the lack of organization and coordination within the course boundaries might make you not to enjoy this class as you should.If you are sure the course will be well organized in the future, do not hesitate to jump in.
Very nice working group to talk to and work with.
