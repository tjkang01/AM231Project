The one thing to be said about this course is that the ratio of learning to required work is very high. However, both quantities are very low.
This is a great course for getting familiar with basic concepts of missing data and reading some fundamental papers, but doesn't involve any technical applications. You won't necessarily learn how to implement any techniques.
if you are enthusiastic about the material and ask questions, will learn alot. don't take it and not engage- that ruins the class for everyone else.
Unless you are very self-motivated, you cannot learn too much from this course.
It is a really good class.
Right now, there isn't enough focus in the class for it to really be beneficial to take. Literally, one can learn everything by simply reading the papers - that isn't how a class should be.
Take it if you are interested in the topic.The material is not easy but the course is not hard.Natesh is energetic and open to discussions and collaborations. In short, take the course if you want to do research on related topics.
If you are planning to take this course, you should have a strong background in statistics, Bayesian statistics, and some knowledge of missing data topics and methods.  The structure of the class does not lend to much teaching-- most of it is exploratory discussion.
