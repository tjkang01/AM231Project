This is a great course if you want to be up to date with the most recent advances in genomics.  We review the latest papers and discuss them - both Shirley and Jun offer great insights.  Course content is subject to change yearly.
Excellent survey of current research topics in computational biology (focus on genomics and cancer). Very little statistics, which may be improved in further iterations.
