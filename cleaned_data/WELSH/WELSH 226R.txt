If you have Middle Welsh as well as interest in medieval literature, this class is not only invaluable to the development of Middle Welsh reading skills, but it's also an absolute pleasure, particularly working so closely with an expert.
This is an extremely fun and rewarding course
Very easy introduction to Middle Welsh, take it!
This is a very enjoyable class, taking Middle Welsh with Professor McKenna has been and remains the most fun I've ever had in a language class.  You learn a great deal, but in a low-stress, enjoyable environment.
Do the translation as conscientiously as possible.  The more time you put into reading and understanding the grammar, the more you'll learn.  That's where the primary learning experience comes from.
