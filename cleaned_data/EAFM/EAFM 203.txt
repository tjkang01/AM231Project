A excellent opportunity to design a syllabus with a conscientious teacher
This class will give you hands-on experience with building a course, but DO NOT FALL BEHIND ON YOUR LECTURE-WRITING as it will destroy all your free time if you have to play catch-up at the last minute.  As long as you stay on top of your work, it's a fun and rewarding experience.
