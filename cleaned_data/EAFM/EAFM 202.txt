THE BEST CLASS EVER. Fantastic films and conversation. Truly a wonderful experience. And I think both undergrads and grads in the class had an equally good time. I cannot recommend it enough.
Do not be afraid of this class!  I was planning on dropping it for the first several weeks because I was so intimidated.  But I stuck with it and it's probably one of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.  Japanese language skill is quite useful but not necessary.
Although it does help to have some prior knowledge of Japanese history before taking the course, the course is designed so that anyone interested can get something out of it even with no prior knowledge of Japanese history or film. The films selected for the class were all very interesting and generated great discussion in class. Highly recommended for anyone interested in learning more about Japanese history through an interesting and engaging medium.
Simply one of the best courses I've ever takenabsolutely fascinating material and great discussions. Every session was a thrill and I'm sorry that it's over.
You'll get to watch some amazing and interesting films and join a community of scholars who are also knowledgeable and interested in Japanese film. Fun times!
Professor Zahlten is an absolutely outstanding professor; he has the rare talent of both being able to lecture in an engaging way as well as to facilitate lively seminar discussion, stepping in to pull the discussion together in productive ways when necessary.
