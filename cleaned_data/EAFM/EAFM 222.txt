Great class, but make sure you have background in Chinese history, and if the class size is less than 12
An intriguing course offering insights in the political, aesthetic and ethical issues related with Chinese new media.
The class is good but the workload is not small.
A student will get more out of this class if they are coming in with some experience in the field of media theory and Chinese studies. Additionally, one should be prepared for a very heavy reading and writing workload if enrolling in this course.
The class size this year was too big. If you were a shy person, or a non-native speaker who is not confident in speaking up in class, don't take a 17-student graduate seminar. Also, the professor lacks the ability to lead class discussions to a meaningful direction.
