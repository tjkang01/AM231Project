The readings could be difficult sometimes but Alex is very nice and will guide you through if you encounter any difficulty. You will learn a lot about media studies and especially Japanese media after this course.
It's a wonderful class. Zahlten is an amazing teacher. It's really really fun and you learn a lot.
Amazing class, especially if you are interested in the topic--the concepts covered are so broad that you probably will find something up your alley. And even if you aren't too eager for the course material, the professor is amazing. Very knowledgable and extremely approachable. Gives detailed feedback, writes interesting prompts for weekly postings, and very open for discussion with students. This year he led all the sections, which after four years here, I can say is pretty amazing for a professor to do. Sections were great, best part of the class--you get to hear what other students think about media in east asia (anime, manga, korean tv, movies, video games, etc etc, the list goes on and on) and often walk away with a bunch of esoteric recommendations to check out. Definitely recommend this course.
This course is valuable on multiple levels: it is a window into East Asian culture, it is a primer on media studies theory, and more broadly, it is an exemplary experience of how fulfilling a class can be when the professor is both engaged in the work of teaching and engaging to students (regardless of the subject matter)
It covers a wide range of topics with considerable depth of insight, and also maintains the interesting narratives which give a general understanding of East Asian cultures.
Extremely interesting and very entertaining materials.
