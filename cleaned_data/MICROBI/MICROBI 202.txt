It's a bit hard, but a very good class
Most helpful if you have not taken a class in Microbial Pathogenesis before.
If you're interested in infectious disease, this is a great course. It was awesome to take as a senior and bring together many of the things I had been studying in my undergrad years. I was at first slightly intimidated to be the only undergrad in the class, but with preparation in cell biology and immunology, I was well-prepared to get a lot out this class. The take-home exams were hard, take your time with them, and think about all the different directions that you could take the questions.
