Well organized course that's fun and informative.
A great class to survey infectious disease research at HMS.
very interactive
Highly recommend for anyone who is considering studying microbiology or infectious disease
Great interactive class, a good overview of research methods in microbiology and infectious diseases. Very well organized.
It is a great way to get exposure to infectious disease research at a variety of levels working in everything from epidemiology to genomics and behavior of organisms and organism communities.
Excellent learning week. Course format well structure.
Really great bootcamp that has several hands on components and a serious yet not stressful atmosphere.
Great introduction to a lot of different fields available within microbiology!
An interesting and exciting class. Very fun and great to see all the research in the area being done on campus (very good if you are looking for a thesis lab in the field).
This course will not make you experts on infectious disease research but it will introduce you to the available facilities at Harvard. This was a very fun one-week course -- you will get to use fluorescent and electron microscopes, you will tour the microbiology lab of Boston Children's Hospital, you will be introduced to current researches by the faculty/researchers in the ID field (and hopefully get to choose which lab you want to work at). I am not a DMS student but I really enjoyed it! Dr. Coleman is nice! A chill course!
One of the best intense course in introduction of infectious diseases
