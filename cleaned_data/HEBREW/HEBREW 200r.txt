Future students for Heb200 will not be checking the Q ratings or whatever to find out about the course!
This is course is great for advanced students in Hebrew Bible, but it has very limited applicability to anyone else.
I'm not sure if I would recommend this class to anyone outside of this field. I think it is a rather stressful class -- and not one in which I learned a great deal about subject matter, but rather received the experience of sitting in front of professors and peers and delivering a paper -- so if one is not in this particular field, I don't think it would be the best class.
