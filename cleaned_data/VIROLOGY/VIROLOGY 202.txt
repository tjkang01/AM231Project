This course is an amazing opportunity to develop valuable skills in proposal writing with the direct guidance from leading scientists. It challenges students to develop an innovative and polished proposal, and in doing so, build invaluable skills and knowledge that will prepare student for the PQE, fellowship applications, and grant applications. Simply put, this is the best course of my grad school experience.
This is a course only for students in the virology program, so this is an odd question. I thin it's useful for improving writing and critical reading skills in professional virology.
This class is useful for developing one's grant writing skills but the timing means that it is a lot of work and takes away from pqe preparations.
A fantastic course which enriches and encourages critical scientific thinking  to a degree and maturity otherwise not reached in other courses.
Come up with a well thought out topic before the start of class

In large part, writing this proposal is exactly like what we've already done in several virology classes. I don't think I gained much insight in addition to what we learned in Viro 201, and it did make it more difficult to dive into lab work with a large amount of work to do for this class.
