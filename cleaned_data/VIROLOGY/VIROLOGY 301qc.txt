That this is a well-thought-out course that address many aspects of virology in an engaging format.
Great course that teaches you to read and understand papers while looking for potential flaws in the data.
Im sorry that this class will not be offered anymore, it truly is a loss.
intensive but good!
Highly enjoyable even though oncogenic viruses are not my thing. Jim makes it a point to have all of us be at ease with talking and it makes learning about the viruses much more fun. Also a useful recap on cell cycle basics.
A useful course to get some background in viral oncology. Even if it's not a research area of interest for you, it will be helpful to be familiar with the key concepts for future seminars and work.
Great class, great instructor.
Good class, good coverage of cancer associated viruses, and Jim Dicaprio is fantastic
Fun introduction to clinically-relevant virology
Although this is a very specific topic, I think the exposure to this area of virology is important and Jim is a fantastic teacher.
This course is fun and very relaxed but you still get a lot out of it - it provides a great overview of oncogenic viruses and you can get a good refresher on cancer biology.
