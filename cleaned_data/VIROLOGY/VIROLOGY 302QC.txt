Great course overall. Open ended discussions covering multiple aspects of viral pathogens of diverse eukaryotic hosts (fungi, plants, protozoa, and insects). Discussions are based on primary literature selected by the students. Would highly recommend to future students!
This class is wonderful - it's a fun environment in which to explore viruses that you don't typically encounter and it gives you a whole new perspective on the animal viruses that are often studied.
