I really enjoyed taking this course, especially since I don't have a Religion background.  Gandhi is  a fascinating person, and there is nowhere else at the college to study him.  This course definitely has the potential to change your life perspective.
This is a really enjoyable course and a great opportunity to engage with interesting material with a very knowledgeable professor. The workload in terms of readings was often a lot but discussions were very engaging and the collaborative nature of the course was a lot of fun. Took this as an elective and really enjoyed it overall.
this class is great! dr. eck is awesome and discussions were always interesting. the reading is demanding, but doable and Gandhi's autobiography is really fascinating. i recommend this class to anyone who is interested in Gandhi or South Asia in general. really chill class!
One of the most valuable discussion classes that educates you on every aspect of your life.
If you are interested in Gandhi, you will learn so many things that you did not know about this amazing man from fellow students and from the experts.
Be prepared to work independently, think critically, and most importantly know how to listen to others.
You'll learn so much about Gandhi, and perhaps be inspired along the way. Gandhi really was a complex figure and there is so much to his life. Professor Eck is wonderful and will make the seminar and discussion interesting. The topics lend themselves to lively discussions, so you are bound to learn from your peers a lot! Great class
You learn about Gandhi, a very interesting man. Diana is great and the class is well worth taking.
