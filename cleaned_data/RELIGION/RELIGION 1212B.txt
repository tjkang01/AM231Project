In combination with Judaim: The Liturgical Year (A), this course provides a fantastic overview of Rabbinic Judaism, which anchors it in its Biblical antecedents as well as its development in later Judaism. The conceptual and creative connections between the Hebrew Bible and the Rabbinic Literature are highlighted, and students should have a good sense of the main features of the Jewish Liturgical Cycle, and its purpose(s), by the end of the second semester.
