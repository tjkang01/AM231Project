A very relaxed course with some very interesting and important lessons about humanity to be learned from it!
If you want an experience unlike any other at Harvard, sign up for this class. Michael Jackson is amazing and you learn so much about the world through a unique lens. How people tell stories is more important than I ever imagined.
