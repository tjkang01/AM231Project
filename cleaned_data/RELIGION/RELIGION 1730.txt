There are some classes at Harvard where if you do not take them, you have missed out on one of the biggest opportunities of a lifetime, this is one of those classes. It is a difficult class, one of the most difficult writing classes I have taken here, but it is so rewarding and you get to discuss really prevalent and interesting issues that span throughout the deepest recesses of time until today :-)  Prof.Gyatso is so supportive and will help you in a myriad of ways, by the time you finish class, you will feel the presence of Prajna-Paramita within you.
It is extremely interesting and will give you a very informed insight into what gender issues are present in Buddhism.  I can't recommend it enough.
This course was phenomenal. Most of the students are graduate students which can be intimidating at times but worth it. The reading is sometimes difficult but always interesting. The lectures are great. Professor Gyatso is both personable and also brilliant. She really challenges everyone to think in a broader scope and about the nuances of any argument, which was really refreshing.
Very interesting perspective on feminism and Buddhism!
Great professor, great discussions, interesting readings.
This course is more fulfilling with a bit of a background in gender studies and Buddhism.  Otherwise, it is lively and interesting.  Unfortunately I think that the relevance of the two subject matters is more important for Buddhism than for gender studies, while I was expecting the course to illuminate both equally.
