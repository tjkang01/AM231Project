This is a great introductory course to philosophy that deals with important issues like rights and ethics.
When I signed up to take this class, I was under the impression that it would be more about hands on human rights and how to think social justice and human rights today. It happened to be much more about the philosophical side of rights. The material for this class is without a doubt interesting, however it was just not what I expected. I was hoping to learn more about combatting human rights violations. If you are interested in the philosophical side of human rights then this is a great class.
