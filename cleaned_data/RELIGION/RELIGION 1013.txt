Very interesting and assignment-light course (just one final paper). Section is extremely interesting - meet an entirely new group of graduate students if you are an undergrad.
A really fascinating and unique class, unlike other poetry classes you might encounter at Harvard. Professor Jackson has really fascinating ideas, and it is a pleasure to engage with them through the lens of poetry.
