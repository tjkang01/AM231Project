This is a great class, albeit a tough one! Reading is a lot - a book a week, 200-400 pages. Of course, Professor Eck does not expect you to read all of it, or to do so intensively, but it is still a class that requires very good reading skills. This class is largely graduates (15/18) so it does have that vibe. Discussion is very interesting and it helps to have one or more traditions from which you draw your reactions. Definitely worth the work! Great class for upper level religion undergraduates!
