This course reminded me why I wanted to come to HDS and study religion and antiquity. I left the course (re)excited and with many more questions about the material than when I began---always a mark of an excellent class. I learned so much from Professor King, the brilliantly curated course materials, and, above all, my fellow students in the course.
