The class was an overview, so I am not sure how much I would suggest this to advanced students in the future.
The presence and heavy intensity of graduate students ruined this course for me. I was hoping to learn about the koran but instead listened to grad students debate circular topics and insult each other.
Make sure you are clear on the aims and requirements of this course (as well as if the wide cross-section of the university population represented) before signing up. Lectures were a bit dry, and the last third of the class focused on student presentations on various surahs, which is something to be aware of.
