This is a stellar course that allows you to work with texts that don't often receive attention in either the English and Religion departments. Matt is a patient, thoughtful, and kind instructor! The conversations are loose but probing. Its like going to the best book club ever twice a week!
Great syllabus; excellent professor. The professor is really insightful and caring and challenges us to think in new ways.
