Really interesting material with a great prof. Seminar + mix of student level = difficult setting in which to learn. Also, beware of the readings.
This course can be difficult if you are not familiar with the topic at hand.  It requires a lot of writing which will be scrutinized if the professor does not agree with your opinion.
Excellent introduction to Isma'ili thought and history.  It allowed me to better understand the sect and its shared history with Shi'ism and Islam in general.  It also allowed me to better appreciate the large impact Isma'ilism had on the greater community both in its political power, Persian poetry and later in high Sufism.
The reading is substantial and sometimes redundant. You will learn a huge amount about the Ismaili tradition and Shiism generally. Few courses teach either, so this class is especially valuable as an antidote to overlook the Shii tradition in academia.
