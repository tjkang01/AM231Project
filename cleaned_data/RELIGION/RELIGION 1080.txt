This is a highly rigorous yet manageable course that will be very enjoyable for students who have previous knowledge (and research interests) in Islam and politics. I would recommend this course to students experimenting w/ research methods and theory, and open to the possibility of working across multiple disciplines and fields.
Zeghal is amazing--she cuts through the noise to get at what is useful about various kinds of research concerning Islam and politics from anthropological, historical, quantitative, and other methodologies.
This is a fantastic course for developing your ability to prepare a research topic and question, think through methodology and explore sources to answer a question you pose yourself. It also exposes you to a great variety of literature in theory of government, then islam and government, and a variety of ways this topic has been studies (statistically, ethnographically, multi-level analysis, etc.)
I would tell them that this course carries a heavy work load, but that Professor Zeghal is brilliant, and very open to sharing her ideas and feedback with her students.
