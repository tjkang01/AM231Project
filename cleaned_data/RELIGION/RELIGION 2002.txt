You have to know how to handle this stuff in religious studies, so, whether you like it or not, you should take this course!
What you get out of this course depends on what you put into it. Try to actually adress the material that interests you, or that you need to deal with in the field. A lot of what is out there is tedious.
Professor Lamberth was great at facilitating conversations.
Different approaches to study of religion. theories and methods must be read and reinterpreted with critical inquiry and interpretation.
Definitely should taken -- even if a ThD -- because a great chance to bond with cohort
Great discussions and opportunities to learn from two very knowledgeable and able professors.
It is a great head start for the second-year review, generals list preparation and prospective writing!
Compared to the horror stories one hears about 2002, this was a joy. Profs M&H put the spoon full of sugar in the medicine.
So long as the course stays this way.  Every 2001 and 2002 course seems as if it has been radically different for every cohort.
This is a class that you must take to fulfill the requirements.  But, while a student in the course you will feel grateful for how Professor Hardacre has structured the assignments/materials.  One of the MOST useful/helpful courses I've taken in the program.
This course is a must for doctoral students in religion interested in navigating the duration of the doctoral program and a profession in academia. It's an awesome class to get answers to questions you didn't even know you had!
