This class was one of my favorite at Harvard -- it obviously self-selects due to the subject matter, but if anyone has any interest, they should take this class for a chance to work with a brilliant professor on fascinating material.
This course was simply one of the most amazing academic experiences of my life. Racha clearly has such passion for and knowledge of the Medieval period, but she was never intimating. She always did her best to bring us up to her level instead of pushing us down. That's the mark of the best teachers. She is super sweet and the course is really relaxed; she is there to help you with the coursework in whatever way you need. Speaking of the coursework, this class is fascinating. Racha picks a really interesting and broad mix of primary sources and contemporary scholarship that covers everything from perceptions of the body, gender roles, relics, mystical theology, and Medieval music, just to name a few. I left this class hooked on the Medieval period. If you have even a passing interest in Religion, the Middle Ages, or the lives of women, take this class. You will not regret it.
