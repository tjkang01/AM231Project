Useful course for students without much background in American religious history but not that relevant to people with stronger backgrounds, so it would depend on who I was talking to.
Professor Brekus is absolutely wonderful, and the course was great for situating the history of religious movements within overall US history. Would highly recommend. Learned a lot and a fun discussion/lecture combo
This class, especially as taught by Professor Brekus, was one of the highlights of my time at Harvard. It's a great overview of American religious history and focuses on gender, race, class, and sexuality. The format of the class and the readings, field trips, movies, etc. all made this very unlike any other class I've taken. It was also good to practice sharing and giving/getting feedback on your work with a small group of peers
