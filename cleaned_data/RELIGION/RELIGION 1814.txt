offer this every other year. It changes one's entire view of ISlam.
It was by far the best class I have taken so far. If you are interested in religion/literature, this is an excellent course which introduces you to many different genres of Muslim devotional literature. It provides information about Islamic history and culture. It includes lots of audio-visual material. Professor Asani is extremely knowledgeable in his field.
