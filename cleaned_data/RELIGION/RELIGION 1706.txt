This course offers a unique opportunity to spend a whole semester on the works of one of the greatest Indian Buddhist philosophers, Vasubandhu. The range of the works of this single author is rich and fascinating, and provides a great introduction into some of the most pressing philosophical problems of his time, and also offering an unusually nuanced understanding of Buddhist doctrines since Vasubandhu writes from a variety of perspectives.
