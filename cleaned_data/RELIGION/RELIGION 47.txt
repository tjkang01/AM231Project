This was an absolutely fantastic class. Probably the most thought provoking class I've taken in my four years here. Sometimes I was intimidated by the extensive background knowledge of others, but as long as you actually do the reading and come prepared, you can learn so, so much and participate in a really engaged learning environment.
Excellent readings and discussion!
It's great.
Fantastic class, great instructor, and thought-provoking & morally challenging material.
Take it if the material interested you!
Great course. You should take it!
