This is one of the most interesting classes that I've taken at HDS. I think Professor Holland is a wonderful facilitator and absolutely brilliant. I also really think that how well the class goes, being largely discussion based, depends on the students. If students do the readings AND come prepared to discuss them--the discussions are among the best I've ever participated in at Harvard.
