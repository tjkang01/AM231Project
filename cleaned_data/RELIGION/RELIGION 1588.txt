This class engages normative, descriptive, and prescriptive ways of understanding and discussing war, peace, and religion in America. I appreciated that the class did not shy away from the moral angles and real human cost of war and American power, even as we developed a complex historical and theological genealogy of war and peace in American history.
Fantastic course from a fantastic professor.  Between the well-thought-out syllabus and insightful class discussions, I would recommend this class to anyone looking for a class at Harvard where you will actually learn something interesting while also learning how to better analyze and think about scholarly work.
