I would recommend it to those with a strong interest in the subject matter
Very manageable and interesting, good instructor
Good, comprehensive overview of this period of Christian history.  Classic history course, not filled with jargon.
A wonderful way to gain a broad knowledge of Christian history through a series of very engaging lectures and fair tests tailored to reinforce recall of the most essential material.
