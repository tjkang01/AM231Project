Professor Madigan is an incredible teacher and person, and for him alone you should take the class. The material is incredibly weighty but so important to come to terms with.
Be open minded.
It was one of the best classes I've taken-- Professor Madigan facilitated discussions really well and the selected material was excellent.
Professor Madigan does a fantastic job of covering both the history of the Church and the Holocaust and philosophical questions about life and death, morality, forgiveness, and genocide.
