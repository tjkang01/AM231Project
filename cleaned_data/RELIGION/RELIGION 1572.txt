Excellent course that analyzes sex and gender from a theoretical perspective
This course has difficult material but is worthwhile.
It is a good introduction to some important texts that is interesting even if you are already very familiar with them.
This course is dense theory but overall if you suffer through the section (mine had one other undergraduate the rest were various masters, graduates, professional studies). Three easy assignments and pretty easy class overall.
