Really a delightful class.
This course is wonderful and highly relevant!
A great class with a great professor that serves as an excellent comparative introduction to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam!
This was a great class and Lockwood was great. It was a very good introduction to the Religion concentration and deparment. However, it is a survey course so anyone going into it should be aware of that. It covers a lot of material, really fast, somewhat superficially. And that's okay for a survey class, but be aware.
This really is stuff that is good to know. Religion is fascinating, and considering these three traditions side by side illuminates each one greatly. Prof. Lockwood is really enthusiastic and does a great job of leading a lecture/discussion class doing justice to both. It's definitely an enjoyable class, and very useful as well. It's a great foundation, both if this is your only experience with religion, and if you want to pursue that interest further.
