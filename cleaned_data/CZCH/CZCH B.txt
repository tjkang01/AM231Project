This class is both extremely instructive, and extremely rewarding. Professor Tuckerova cares about her students, and does everything she can to make sure that all of us grasp the concepts. She is an excellent professor and is the reason why I continued with a second year of Czech. If you have any interest in taking a foreign language, you should consider this class.
If you have a passion for language or would like to learn more about a powerful culture, take this course.
best teacher ever
That Ms.Tuckerova, does an excellent job of making Czech more accessible to foreigners.
If you have any interest in learning a new language, this should be on your radar. The class is exceptional, the professor amazing, and the experience one which cannot be described adequately with words.
Nora is an excellent Czech teacher. If you apply yourself and really work outside of class too, Nora can help you learn a lot.
I think that everyone should take a Slavic Language while at Harvard because they are very logical once the declension system is learned.  I think that anyone interested in a small course with this type of system will benefit an ambitious student in the long run.
