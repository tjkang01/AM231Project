Veronika is great! She's a very supportive teacher and it seems like she tailors the material to suit the interests of the class, which is great.
I had a lot of fun working with Prof. Tuckerova again in this class, she was able to answer all questions I had about the language as well.
This class is great!  Veronika is wonderful, and Czech is a very interesting language.
