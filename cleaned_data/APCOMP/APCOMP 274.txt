This is an excellent course if you are interested in finite element methods, which are useful for fluid mechanical problems in general domains. The resulting codes are not necessarily the fastest, but if you need to deal with obstacles in flow, etc.., this will be useful for you. The course has a high workload and is time consuming, but you learn a lot about the methods.
Sauro really knows his stuff and clearly cares about tailoring the class to the abilities and interests of his students.  The material can be challenging depending on your background in physics and computation, but the workload was pretty low.  Be prepared to be called up to the board!
I believe this class is great if you are pursuing excellence in fluid mechanics and soft matter. The class let you explore a topic of interest with the guidance of high-level teaching staff.
