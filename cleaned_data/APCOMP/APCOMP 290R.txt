This is potentially a very useful in learning large scale computing that you can't find in any other courses, but since it is the first year, there are some kinks to work out. I think it will only get better in the future.
The experience of this class will vary widely with the particular modules that are presented, so I'm not sure that my experience will be applicable to anyone else.
Taking a course that's being offered for the first time is always a risk but this course was entirely mismanaged. I would recommend speaking to the instructors about the ways in which this course is being improved before taking it.
Great class if you are looking to see what problems are being solved in domains other than the most common internet/finance domain problems.
To be forthcoming in issues with the course since it is new and focus more on picking up the important computing fundamentals.
