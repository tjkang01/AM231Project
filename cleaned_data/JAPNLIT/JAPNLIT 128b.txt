If you enjoy literature but don't have wide knowledge of the period/location covered in this course, it's a great choice! I don't know that it would have been as valuable for those who are already experts in the field, as it is fairly basic, but it's an excellent introductory course. And the professor is wonderful, very knowledgeable and a lot of fun!
If you enjoy analyzing literature and are interested in Japanese culture/history, this is a good class for you.
The class requirements are straightforward, and the subject material is a *lot* of fun.
