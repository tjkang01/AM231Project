Though Japanese studies students might be hesitant to take a class on what seems like a niche subject, I would argue that this class can contribute to an understanding of Sino-Japanese cultural relations, as well as to certain intellectual trends in Japanese history, and thus has a broader applicability that one might expect. And for people interested in Chinese poetry in China--what a great opportunity to see what was going on across the pond!
Be prepared to buckle down and read a lot, but you will be rewarded for the work. It's fascinating stuff.
