I was a little apprehensible at first about taking a gender studies class but it really opened my understanding of the social implications and arbitrary nature of gender assignments.  I also find that after taking this class, gender studies is actually an applicable approach to many of the other humanities and offers new insight into relations even between countries.
The professor is amazing. She is so nice and really wants you to learn and enjoy the material while you're learning. Really, best class of my semester.
