Always do the readings, they are very interesting and discussion can be really productive
Loved this course. As a student with no prior experience in Japanese literature beyond a very area-specific set of texts, this course was marvelous. Joanna is an incredible instructor, empathetic and very knowledgeable, and the students enrolled in the course are contagious in their passion for Japanese history and culture. Even those with little or no background in Japanese lit will find Japan Lit 140 an excellent opportunity to read widely and be exposed to many critical authors in the last century of published protest fiction.
The course introduced me to a wide range of authors, works and history that I knew nothing about. In particular political engagement felt very meaningful, a reminder that academic work is very much a part of the wider world.
