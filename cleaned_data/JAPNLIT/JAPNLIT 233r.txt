This is a once in a life time chance to read Genji like this - take it if you can!
If you like Prof. Cranston's style, it doesn't get any better than this course!
Professor Cranston is unique in all the world; you will never again find another scholar with such passion and such a genius for sharing it with his students.  If you want to learn classical Japanese literature, there is simply no better professor.
