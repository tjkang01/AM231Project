Modern Armenian literature was the most enjoyable lit course I've taken at Harvard.
A truly fascinating introduction to the rich literary history of Armenia. Professor Russell is an undisputed expert in this region, and brings a fascinating blend of literary, historical, and political analysis to the texts. The size of the class fostered also facilitated great discussion on the authors and the works they created. This class greatly deepened my understanding of the region and its literary landscape.
