So much fun.  Andreu is the most easygoing, flexible, personable, fun instructor I've had!  Great chance to get to know a new culture with many parallels to other regional and minority cultures.
This class is a great way to learn a little known language.  Knowledge of Catalan can help you understand other romance languages, and give you insight into a culture that would otherwise be inaccesible.  The teacher is great and your classmates will be people who really want to learn.  Enjoy it!
Andreu is fantastic. The course is a really interesting look at the culture of Barcelona and at the catalan language. A joy.
You will not be fluent by the end of the year; however, your ability to understand written Catalan will be pretty good and spoken will depend on your familiarity with other Romance languages.
THIS THE GREATEST CLASS EVER. Take it if you enjoy learning languages, love Spain, and want to have a great time.
