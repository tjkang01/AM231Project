Great, light-hearted introduction to Catalan language and culture.  Doesn't move very quickly, but if you already speak another Romance language, you pick up enough building blocks to communicate/read fairly well (daily conversations, newspapers) by the end of just one semester.  Andreu's got a great sense of humour and a lot of fun.
It's fun
If you're just looking to satisfy you language requirement, this class is a godsend. There isn't much work required, and section is actually really fun.If you are actually interested in Catala, this is an amazing introduction. Compared to the other intro language class I've taken at Harvard what we learned in this class is actually useful for traveling. I would highly recommend this course.Also, there are only likely to be like 6 or 7 people in the class, so you get as much help as you want/need
Take it. Go to Barcelona. Then, thank yourself for taking this course.
I like Catalan, an Andreu is a great guy, but it is not that well planned. If we had a textbook it would have made it 50% better.
