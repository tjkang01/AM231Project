This is a good course for introducing theoretical aspects of computing.  If you are looking to gain experience in a programming language, this is not the right course for you.  Take this course if you want gain some ways of thinking about algorithms both in terms of efficiency and stability.  Relative to other courses, the out-of-class workload is relatively light.  The homeworks, out-of-class exam, and project were challenging, but fair, and anyone with an introductory level understanding of a computer programming language can do well in this course.
