A great class to get a basis in clinical trials and learn about current topics and issues in clinical trials from guest lectures who are experts in these areas!
Great class. Probably the most relevant class if you plan to go into industry.
This course gives a thorough introduction of clinical trials. Even if your future concentration is not in clinical trials, you will still benefit from taking it.
Steve is a great professor, and the guest lectures are interesting. I'm sure the class will only improve with age.
Useful class that is not too much work.
