This course is a mathematically satisfying look at some important practical methods in causality, including a formal axiomatic framework for causality, Directed Acycic Graph representations, Marginal Structural and Structural Nested Models.  A background in semiparametric theory would be quite helpful,  but can be substituted for by some extra studying on projections in Hilbert spaces.
