CS 284 is about as good as it gets for a course on underactuated robotics.  Professor Kuindersma was excellent.  The lecture notes were taken in real time, which is just a great idea.  There wasn't a whole lot of problem sets to solidify the ideas.  I suppose that is left mostly to the student.
For computer scientists, this course is about optimization - how to convert physical problems into optimization problems, how to solve them in various conditions, and how to prove your solution is correct, using more optimization.  Even if you don't do robots, optimization is a very useful tool to have in many circumstances.
It's a difficult class, however if you successfully get into it, you definitely would learn a lot. Otherwise, it will be a really painful class, since the content gets harder and harder. If you don't have a study partner and try to do everything by yourself, it may become impossible if you fall behind. Office hour is important, also I got really sharp TFs this time. Please don't waste your office hour if you take this class, make a good use of it. You will learn a lot if you are prepared. By the way, if you see one of your TF is Zachary Manchester, guys you are lucky, you are going to learn a ton from him. In general, it's a good class, highly recommend if you like walking robots.
Some physical dynamics is essential to doing well in this course.
While this class definitely covers A LOT of topics in various areas, expertise in those topics is not required to do well in the class. Prof. Kuindersma's enthusiasm is enough to keep motivated throughout the semester, and the material is all very useful and cool.
