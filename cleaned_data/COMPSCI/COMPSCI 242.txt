It's a great research based seminar, make sure you have an area/active research project of interest you can talk about.
Good lecture based class to take with machine learning.
This was one of my favorite classes at Harvard! I learned about some very relevant and very interesting areas of computer science. HT is terrific and you should always take a class with him. The other students were great too and I learned a lot about their research.
