This course is amazing. A lot of fun, learning a lot of cool things, great teaching.
This is primarily a seminar, with 2 - 5 papers read per week. Material is great, with a solid progression. Each class, a student or professor will be teaching new material with a focus on questioning and evaluating the papers. There's a final project, which I thought was asking for a lot of work in both theory and simulation over the course of a few weeks. I found Greg to be a pleasure to work with, and David was fairly accessible, though he can come off as a bit hard to chat with sometimes.
You'll learn a lot of interesting things with a very engaged professor (Parkes). Take it with some of your smart friends to get more out of it.
