The class has a lot of good material, but be ready to work and understand things on your own. The material starts out straightforward and can become a little overwhelming if you don't reach out to the TF and professor.
you learn a lot about digital design and the project at the end helps show just how practical the skills you learn are.
It's a fun class, and the final project is pretty cool.
Professor Wei is a great professor and this course is one of the most useful for the real world.  Take it if you can!
As long as Professor Wei is still teaching this class, this class will always have an amazing lecture component that facilitates a lot of discussion, which has made this class one of my favorites in all my time here. If you enjoy small classes with a lecture that seems more like a conversation about digital circuits or have always wondered how digital designers actually do their work, this class is for you.
The class is great. Gu's lectures are incredible and he ensures that everyone is on th same page before moving on.
