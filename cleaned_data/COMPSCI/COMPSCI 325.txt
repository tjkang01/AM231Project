If the reason that I failed the quals is because the problem that I am trying to solve is not a computer science problem, then the professor should have told me when I chose this topic. If the reason that I failed the quals is because I could not demonstrate my future direction, then the professor should have told me much earlier, instead of telling me that I need to prepare for this topic 3 days before the quals. If the above two reasons were actually not the reasons failing the quals, then the professor should have told me the real reasons.
