This is a must take class.
Waldo's enthusiasm for the topic is very apparent and the discussions are even more engaging. There are weekly assignments that don't take too much time, in addition to a final project that ties the whole course together.
If you are not a CS concentrator, I would recommend this course with reservations for a few reasons. While this course did help me understand better what technology is capable of doing, it hammered home themes that I was already familiar with coming in as an econ concentrator. People/companies have enough incentives to collect data so they will naturally do so. I feel like my peers in this class had entered this class with the belief that technology can fix everything; by the end of the class, they had become more cautious about applying technology. If you are already cautious, you don't need a whole course to teach you this. This class teaches you about fish, but it doesn't teach you how to fish or even how to better analyze fish. It just teaches you to be more suspicious of fish. (This is an analogy) Also, there should have been more opportunities for us to learn from our peers (and the different ways they think). Discussions/debates about topics ended up being more two-sided rather than multilateral.
Waldo is super funny and smart, and it's worth it to take it just to hear him talk
If you need this for a CS secondary requirement or for a gen-ed, it is a gem. You don't write a shred of code. You also learn literally nothing. Found the class to be a mindless waste of 3 hours a week. The beginning of every class is 25 minutes of "share what you read in the news this week on privacy!!!". Every weekend, you will have a writing assignment. Alternates weekly between group writing and individual writing. They are both annoying. You can expect to write 1-2 pages every weekend. That being said, this is not real writing. It is class A, liberal arts, BS writing. Pretty sure everyone BS's there way through the entire course. Waldo talks all hifalutin throughout the entire semester. Every class is pretty much the exact same as the first class during shopping period. He'll tell you 4 interesting facts and say seven times how you'll "get to this later in the semester," and how this class will "change the way you approach technology." It's a semester of repeated, empty promises. So don't expect to actually have your perspective on privacy changed. Reading the wikipedia article on Privacy would probably be more informative. All of this being said, it is an easy class. Waldo does, supposedly, give out a bunch of A's. You will talk about a couple of interesting things. The final project is pretty painless, and if you choose a cool topic, can be fun. Definitely beats a hard, coding-intensive CS class. With regards to the application, just make a one minute video with some pretty pictures and dialogue, and what not. I only put in 2-3 hours on a Sunday night. Pretty sure anyone that gives it the minimum amount of effort gets in.

It's one of the best courses on campus. Definitely apply and hope for the best.
Absolutely a fantastic class; one of my favorites at Harvard. Come prepared for lots of discussion and writing on real, hard-to-answer issues (as well as Prof. Waldo and Latanya's great lectures.)
This course is a fantastic experience. The professors are very passionate, you will interact with your classmates, and are required to stay up to date and speak about current technology and privacy trends. This is a very important topic that more computer scientists, legislators, businessmen, and anyone who cares about the way our lives will change with technology need to think about.
This class will make you think much more critically about privacy -- and the lack thereof -- in society.
There's a reason why this class is so heavily lotteriedProf. Waldo is a great teacher, and this class covers fascinating and relevant issues of the day.
This is an amazing course. Waldo is amazing and you will learn a lot (although you may come out slightly more cynical about the level of privacy you have). You have an essay or project every weekend which is work, but it teaches you how to work quickly, efficiently, and in groups. If you think you might want to take it at any point in your time at Harvard apply to get in! Even if you don't get in that year, it will help you in future years.
This class is what every Harvard class should be. The discussions are always engaging, Professor Waldo puts together an enthusiastic and diverse class of students, and the topics covered both prepare you and scare you just enough to deal with today's ever-growing privacy issues in light of technological advances--and what policy can or cannot (and should or should not) do to protect us from them.
Don't take this class if you're expecting it to be pure Gov or pure CS. It is the most interdisciplinary class offered at Harvard and maintaining that mindset is necessary for success. Professor Waldo is incredibly receptive and wants to tailor the class to what the students want, so the more you put in, the more you get out. If you're lucky enough to be a part of this class, get the most out of it possible. This is the best course I've taken during my time here.
This course is a really great discussion-based class where you can learn a very different side of computer science - one related to policy making and relevant current events in relation to privacy rather than coding necessarily. It makes me see computer science in a much broader governmental light!
(i) It improved my writing. (ii) Gave me a reason to think about privacy (whereas before it wouldn't really have crossed my mind).(iii) Was a great, relaxing, engaging, fourth course which got me thinking about the world without adding a lot of stress to my week. (iv) Prof. Waldo is a boss and it's awesome to take a course with him.
Apply to get in every year, and God forgive you if you get in and don't enroll. Interesting, easy, you learn a lot. The liberal arts ideal.
This course covers an interesting and broad range of topics and introduces many fundamental ideas in the field. Professor Waldo is a good lecturer and encourages the students to have fun with the material. The class's smaller discussion format is also a welcome change from the typical lecture-style gen eds, and it's a good opportunity to meet lots of new people. This is a course where you don't need to put in a lot of time to get a lot out of the course; it's a very doable and interesting gen ed.
This is a fantastic CS course to take, especially if you're wondering how you can apply tech to things outside of programming and theory at Harvard. Jim Waldo is a BEAST and makes the class entertaining and engaging. Would highly recommend especially if you have a really busy semester - the assignments were totally doable and very informative.
This class gets very hyped up, but it's honestly a bit of a let down. The wide range of skills in the class means that you can't really touch on any topic with depth. In the end it was actually very boring.
Worth taking. Ideally it would more rigorously examine both the relevant technology and policy issues, but it's still a fun and interesting survey of the core problems with privacy and technology. Big, big bonus points for being directly applicable to students' everyday concerns and experiences (and kudos to the teaching staff for actively trying to keep the course relevant to these concerns and experiences).
CS 105 is a great class. Jim Waldo is extremely enthusiastic about the class and really devotes himself to the class and students.
EVERYONE should try and be in this class. Even though Professor Waldo would probably say that the class is half "techies" and half "policy kids," don't be deterred if you don't fit either of these description. As digital natives in today's day and age, anybody has the interest and skillset required for a class like this. The class forces you to consider questions of privacy and technology that you have probably dabbled over discussions before briefly, but haven't really considered in depth. By nature of the class size and the application process (which is super easy, even though you'd be surprised how many people this prevents from trying for the class), you get to know the people in the class and Professor Waldo (who is awesome). The class changes as events unfold which makes it even better (ie. email threat scandal), and Jim Waldo's position within the university gives a really interesting perspective on privacy in the context of Harvard. TAKE THIS CLASS, EVERYONE!
This class is completely eye opening. You should absolutely take it, and be prepared to learn a lot of shocking things about privacy that you take for granted.
This class hugely improved my ability to think about difficulties in developing policy around technologies, and about the interactions of technology, society, and governance.
This course is interesting, hilarious, insightful, engaging, very manageable, and changes your approach to technology regardless of your background. I love the interdisciplinary nature of the people accepted to this course and the issues we covered. This course inspired me to write a government thesis on the topics we covered in lecture. Professor Waldo is one-of-a-kind. Apply for this class (get creative, humor helps), and be ready for a class unlike most at Harvard.
This course was very enjoyable--one of my favorite courses I have taken here at Harvard. Professor Waldo is one of the best professors I've encountered. The course might have been better, had I had a little background in technology and computer science (there were some conversations in class in which I felt I wasn't fully equipped to participate in), but the environment of the class was such that no matter what type of background you came from, there was still much to learn and enjoy.
Everyone needs to take one class with Prof. Waldo before graduating.
TAKE THIS CLASS
This was an excellent course overall; if you're a CS secondary who is less comfortable with some of the more technical courses, and you can get into CS105, then take it. Workload is extremely minimal, Waldo is a fantastic professor, and discussions are genuinely engaging.
This is really a gem of a course. The peers who you talk with and who clearly all have something to say about privacy issues are incredibly diverse in the backgrounds they come from, which I think is one of the strongest facets of this course. Waldo and Sweeney are among the brightest minds in this field, and are incredible just to hear, let alone interact and speak with (to which they are surprisingly accessible). Super great course -- if you get in, do it. If you're not sure about applying, apply.
This is an amazing class! You will get as much out of it as you put in. There are a some readings for every class but not as much towards the end of the class. The final project is open ended and a great way to investigate something you are passionate about. Prof Waldo has a lot of resources and really makes an effort to make the material accessible, interesting, and hands-on.
Even though the application might seem daunting, just do it. It's a great course with a reasonable courseload that covers a lot of interesting materials. It's also not very technical in nature.
This class is absolutely incredible -- you get to talk about privacy issues with an amazing group of driven, smart people. Also, Jim Waldo and Latanya Sweeney are such interesting, sociable, fun people, and I feel like I grew as a person while taking this class. Recommend with enthusiasm x 100.
This is an incredible class, but don't sleep on it. It's a good amount of writing. I almost think of it more as a government/policy class than a computer science class, but as a cs person it really pushed me to grow. I've learned an incredible amount in this class.
This was the best course I have taken at Harvard. It is one of those courses that every student should have to take as it opens our eyes to so many pertinent issues of today.
This class is great and teaches you so much on how to shape a world view in today's technology age.
When I took this class, I was a senior majoring in Social Studies looking to complete her Culture and Belief requirement with a well-reviewed class. Though I came from a non-tech background and was in my last year of college, this course was one of the best experiences of my time at Harvard and continuously impacted my perspective. I just had so much FUN in class. Prof. Waldo and the other students selected for the class never ceased to be engaging. The assignments were thought-provoking and interesting to write. I am now considering ways in which I can incorporate my newfound understanding of privacy and technology in the long-term.
Think of this class as an HBS course. While this class generally does not use a case study method, the way you learn things is very much through discussing ideas then applying them to the world around you. It isn't often that you get this in the context of computer science, and it is a welcome shift. There is a reason this course is heavily lotteryed, but if you get in you're going to have a good time.
The content of this course was really interesting. As someone with no tech background, I learnt a lot from it, and also developed a desire to learn more in the future. Professor Waldo was informative, enthusiastic, and understanding of the fact that the class had a wide variety of people with different interests and skills. The course structure could sometimes be a bit annoying: the bi-weekly group papers are a nightmare to coordinate, especially if you are travelling on the weekends. The readings are somewhat inconsequential and don't come up in class: some are interesting to read anyway, though plenty of them are not.
It is a great class to learn on a high-level about policy and technological issues regarding privacy.  It is super manageable in terms of work -- a paper assigned every Thursday and due every Sunday that alternates between being individual and group-written. It is great for people of all backgrounds -- people of technology backgrounds are likely to learn about the policy side and vice versa. It's also a great way to meet people, and the final projects are a super fun time where you can explore topics in depth or create a cool program. Just try for the lottery -- if you show interest and creativity, there's a high chance you'll get in! (And an even higher chance you'll get in the next year!)
Definitely take this class! I took it for the gen ed requirement and it's the only gen ed class I've taken that I think actually gave me useful information for daily life. Professor Waldo is great, it's not too much of a time commitment, and you get to cover some really interesting topics!
Take this class!  One of the best I have taken at Harvard.  The TFs are great and Professor Waldo is a rare kind of professor at Harvard: he really cares about his students and takes the time to get to know them.
Definitely take this class if you can get in, there are multiple topics in this class that blew my mind, I thought previously that I was oversuspicious etc but this course objectively shows you how far into the Panopticon we have descended in the most subtle way. It also teaches you to write position papers very well and gets you to think in depth about real world policy/regulatory implications. Super interesting class, Professor Waldo is amazing,
This is a great course. Waldo is really funny and chill. The group projects take some time getting used to and each group functions differently but by the end, you get the hang of it. Definitely recommend if you can get in!
This class really changed the way I viewed the world in terms of privacy. I am now a proud tin-foil hat wearer. If you can get into the class, take it. Prof. Waldo has a refreshing level of sarcasm and cynicism unique to Harvard.
This class is the most welcoming introduction to the world's best keep secrets. The teaching staff constantly remind you that even with just one semester of information, you are better equipped than most politicians at the helm of making technology decisions (which is scary considering...) Definitely ushers you into the world of technology policy and fosters your sense of confidence  in being there.
This class was incredibly interesting and did not have any busywork. I learned about a lot of cool topics and my critical thinking skills improved. On top of all of this, it is incredibly relevant to current events. I really recommend it!
This class is incredible. Try to lottery in and hope that you get in.  If you do, this class will honestly change your life. You'll start thinking about the technological and legal ramifications of everything that you do. Download a new iTunes version? You might actually look at the Terms of Service before you click "Accept". As for the weekly papers? They're not bad at all. The first few weeks will take you a while to write, but you'll quickly adopt a system to get them done in a few hours.
this class was fantastic and my favorite class this semester. unique in how it is structured and the culture of the class. incredibly relevant, fun, and not too much work. there is an essay/assignment due every sunday, but it was never excessive or a waste of time.
Very interesting and not a giant time commitment-- overall an excellent class!
The professors and TFs definitely have different approaches to grading, which makes for some confusing grades at the end of the class.  The material is incredibly interesting though and definitely worth exploring.
TAKE THIS CLASS.Professor Waldo is the BEST professor in the CS department. Even if you don't get in, try taking another course taught by him, or visit his office. He's super nice, kind, cares a lot about his students. His lectures are always interesting and clear. He is extremely witty, and makes class (and assignments) a whole lot fun!The material is thought-provoking, and they usually bring incredible guest speakers to talk on issues such as revenge porn or Facebook. And these speakers are always people immersed in that industry or issue and who know a whole lot about their subject matter.The assignments are always really interesting and fun. You have to write papers over the weekend, so be prepared for that, but it's definitely manageable. You also acquire a lot of skills that you might not get from other classes, such as how to write efficient policy papers and how to work in groups.Take it. Take it. Take it.
Great class!
Take this class! Definitely worth the application.
Professor Waldo makes this course and makes my life
Fantastic class. Relevant (especially after Snowden) and interesting. Pretty low stress. Lots of freedom with final project. The group papers are not fun (too many chefs in the kitchen), but they're not too terrible.
This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. The material is extremely relevant to modern life, and the class will completely change your perspective on privacy and empower you to competently argue your opinion. Frequent assignments, but they're quick. Lots of group work gets hard to coordinate, but most of the paper topics are interesting to think about/argue.
This class can be pretty easily summarized as "because of technology, privacy no longer exists", I don't know if taking an entire course is necessary to learn this.
Great course, awesome professors. If you get in, take it obviously.
Really great class, highly recommend it.  Learn a lot from the professors and learn a lot from the other students in the class.
Such a unique class! Exposes you to a ton of really important topics VERY related to current events. It's a class that once you take, you realize how important it is that you took it and were able to think about such pertinent problems. If you get in, TAKE IT.
You should apply. If you get in, you should take it. That simple.
You will want to, and look forward to attending class every week. You should enjoy group work
If you have the chance to take this, you absolutely should. It was a very interesting addition to my course load with a ton of real world relevancy. Prof. Waldo is super engaging! I enjoyed the flexibility within this class to respond to Harvard specific issues (like re-writing the Harvard email privacy policy) or goings on in the world. If you're interested, definitely apply. It's worth it!
Excellent, definitely apply!
Assuming similar format:- Light workload: the group writing assignments get smoother as the term progresses but can still be quite time-consuming. Block off a window on Sunday night to be able to work on these with your group.- The readings are not really required. It felt as if no one did them. Some weeks I got to them, others I didn't, and to be honest, didn't feel like I got a ton out of the lecture with them because Waldo or Sweeney rarely refer to them.- Waldo and Sweeney are friendly and fun to take to the faculty dinner. Both are working in exciting areas.- You have to be comfortable with other undergraduates marking your writing.- If you end up taking this class, be sure to put your position right up at front like they tell you.
One of the best practical courses here at Harvard, a must for future policy-makers. Waldo, University CTO is the one of the gem professors at Harvard. If you are lucky enough get a chance to take his courses, do not hesitate to grab it. Prof. Sweeney, who co-taught the course, is extremely intelligent, has an impressive resume, and is an expert in privacy. You cannot ask for better course instructors, or a more interesting, relevant topic to today's world and the future.
Definitely apply and try to get in. The professors make this class incredibly interesting and fun - you are actually excited to go to class.
Papers and projects are assigned on Thursdays and due on Sunday, so be aware of that. This class is awesome, interesting, and you get to meet really smart, unique individuals.
Take this course! You get to work one in one with amazing professors and it truly does change your perspective on privacy.
CS 105 is an extremely well-taught, interesting course. It gave me the opportunity to think about some really tough questions surrounding privacy. Group assignments really aren't bad if you start early!
It's not worth going through Harvard without taking this course. Professors Waldo and Sweeney are incredibly smart, engaging, and concerned with challenging their students, and the topics of privacy and technology are incredibly relevant to the way our world works now and will work in the future. The workload is incredibly low, and don't believe what you hear about the group projects being hard - it gets much easier after the first one.
Apply! It is definitely worth writing the essay and making the video. You will learn a lot and both professors are excellent.
This is an amazing class. It is hands down my favorite class I've ever taken at Harvard, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone else. Professors Waldo and Sweeney are very engaging professors (and it helps that the material itself is super interesting). What you'll find is that the material covered is very relevant and pretty thought provoking. I don't think I'll look at a webcam the same way ever again (and maybe I shouldn't even be looking directly at one).The assignments are pretty simple, although it's group work heavy so be prepared to coordinate schedules with people and work over the weekend. It's not too work intensive, so a solid days' of work should suffice.Just want to recommend everyone who can to TAKE IT!! It's an amazing class!!!
This course is taught very well and the teaching staff alone makes it worth taking. Don't think you need to be a CS concentrator to understand the course material or enjoy the course.
One of my favorite classes.  The professors are amazing, the topics are really interesting and important to learn about, and the class is always surprising and entertaining.  The guest speakers are also ones you don't want to miss.  Be prepared to write either a short individual or longer group paper every weekend, but it's worth it.  Definitely recommend this class for people in any field!
Fantastic class. Learned a lot, not too much work, interesting material. What more can you ask for?
Be prepared for a brisk pace.  This course is less pattern-bound than others:  one or more assignment ground rules shifted substantially every week.  Have a Google Docs site ready to go for team projects.
The papers due every week will be rough. Assigned on Thursday midday and due Sunday midday. That being said, if you can arrange your schedule accordingly, take this course! A little extra work on the weekends shouldn't be enough to discourage you. I learned so much. Professor Waldo and Sweeney are total rockstars.
Amazing, amazing class. It's so worth it to do the video and the application - the people in the class, not just the professors, have a whole variety of experiences that makes the class really interesting.
This is a great class to fulfill a gen ed requirement and possibly get interesting perspectives on relatively unique topics.  However I felt that I didn't learn or gain much from this class outside of writing more concisely.
This class is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Led by industry thought-leaders, and with a small group of some of the most talented students at Harvard: this class was always a pleasure to attend.
Course material was interesting, but the real selling point of this course was the professors -- highly interesting people, very approachable, and a pleasure to interact with.
This course will likely be unlike any other that you've had at Harvard. It's taught in a large discussion format, about material that is incredibly relevant to daily life. Whether you're CS or not, the interesting diversity of students in this class is unlikely to be found in any other. Professor Waldo is an incredibly influential professor, who makes the class entertaining and informative, and puts in a huge amount of effort to make the class refreshing. Regardless of what you're studying, this class is a must-take -- if you can get in the lottery!
Professor Waldo is very knowledgable and friendly. I liked this course because I got to explore the policy side of computer science as opposed to just the technical side.I only wished that there was no cap of 30 students for this course. If a whole lot of students like privacy and technology, Harvard must offer resources to give them a chance to learn rather than stymie most of them.
Often GenEd classes (and classes at Harvard in general) are not applicable to real life. This could not be further from the truth for CS 105. Not only does this class inform you on some major privacy dilemmas in technology and some cool (but creepy) technologies, it teaches you some useful methods of analysis and thinking (policy briefs, threat models, etc.). On top of that, Professor Waldo and Sweeney are both fantastic. Overall, a wonderful learning experience.
Please take this course. Prof. Waldo and Prof. Sweeney are amazing. The topic is incredibly interesting and will open your mind about privacy and technology. Also the workload really isn't that bad considering I took it my senior fall along with writing a senior thesis and doing recruiting.
It's a great class to learn about a lot of current issues with respect to technology. Not a lot of work but very creative!
If you can get in to this course, you HAVE to take it. Best Culture & Belief course hands down. Counts for CS (secondary). Professor Waldo is hilarious and awesome. Topics are extremely interesting and relevant.To get it, talk about some really interesting and atrocious violation of privacy. Plus points if you interned at Facebook for the privacy team. And make a memorable video.
It's a really cool class if you put the time into it. Think about your final project early as it'll be a lot more interesting.
This is a really cool course that lets you really think about the different privacy implications of the technology we use. It makes you take a step back and see what we take for granted.
It's a great class but you really need to be interested in the material, since it's so discussion based! The assignments are unlike most other things you'll find at Harvard - no psets, no traditional papers. The position papers and 'group' papers have a unique style that may take a few weeks to get used to.
Communicate with your teammate!
material can get repetitive, and since there is little structure to the course, the expectations are vague and so you can often get really bad grades when you thought, in fact, you did something well
Pay attention in lecture because that will help you a lot with the individual assignments. Also, this class is all about the final project, so start thinking about that early.
Everybody should take this course if given the opportunity. Professor Waldo & Sweeney are excellent. I always looked forward to going to this class, and it teaches you invaluable information about the realities of the 21st century.
We have fun discussions on privacy topics - be sure to participate! Also, start on the papers early...this is not a freebie easy class!
Absolutely fantastic! This is a gem of a course at harvard and rare in that it teaches you using real world examples and common sense.
CS105 is the ideal GenEd; not too much work, incredibly interesting and engaging, and you're able to really view society (or at least those "privacy agreements" that you don't read) in a whole new light.  Working in a group can be tough (since you have to do it often), but it is certainly useful if you haven't done so already.
We start off class by talking about current events. When you begin searching for things to talk about you realize how truly relevant this class is to everyday life.
This is a great course. You will learn a lot and your mind will be blown multiple times. Expect assignments to be a bit vague and organizing with your group to be occasionally hectic. It's doable, but asking the professors about what they want from you is always a good idea.
This was a good class. Very interesting and applicable to everyday life. The assignments are really interesting and generally manageable in terms of the time they take. There are many group assignments, which could be a good or bad thing, but I found it was good to get more experience working in a group. The readings are not too long. This class challenges you to engage with the material, and really think for yourself, but isn't too hard in terms of what it requires from you. It will change your outlook on much of your public existence and how you think about what is private and what should be private or not. Good class. Great access to the professors. They love this class and want to make it great, and it is really good because of it.
Good discussion-based class.The structure changes every year so it is hard to comment on that, but I really enjoyed the material even if the execution wasn't always flawless.
The class is fun! You'll learn as much from coming to class early as you will from class itself. The professors are great!
Do it if you really are interested in privacy.  Otherwise, you may not find it very interesting.
It's an easy course and one of the BEST Gen Eds! It is both applicable, has technology, and manageable. It is a perfect balance of what a great class should be. Also, Professor Waldo is so cool! He knows his stuff and he's not condescending at all about it when you don't understand something if you're not from a computer scient background. Take it!
Very unique class, and not one to blow off.  The papers take some time.
Take it. The material covered is always going to be relevant to anyone living in the digital age, and the format of the class is nothing like your standard Harvard Gen Ed. Both professor Waldo and professor Sweeney are effective lecturers.
You learn a lot in the class about the technology field and how different things work. They grade pretty hard on your writing. They have a very particular writing style that they like.  You do a lot of group work. You have to get your work done quickly as well ( Thursday- Sunday)
Do it! Professors are so chill and cool, and you will learn things that are very relevant to your life (aka you have no privacy...). Although more work than I expected, the load was still manageable.
Excellent course!  Interesting, relevant topics that you'll be itching to discuss with your friends.  Watch out for the weekly assignments - there's more writing in this class than you might expect.  Final project can be whatever you'd like, and they ended up being pretty awesome.  Overall, definitely recommend the course to anyone, with any background.
This was a fantastic course that fosters awareness of privacy issues beyond the commonly considered ones (such as social networking sites, etc). Also, this course allows students to really hone concise writing skills.
Not a difficult class, very interesting and very applicable to the world of technology that we live in. The papers assigned kind of sucked because they would be group papers assigned thursday and dud sunday afternoon which made it really difficult but I learned a lot of interesting things. Easily the most interesting class I've taken at Harvard.
Very, very interesting course.  Would definitely recommend.
If you take one course at Harvard, take this one.  I cannot even begin to explain how much I learned in one semester about solving real world problems at the intersection of Computer Science, Law, Government, Economics, privacy, and security.  In addition to learning a ton, the course is led by a phenomenal teaching staff that goes out of their way to make themselves accessible.  When I first started this class I was terrified of public speaking, but over the course of the semester with the help of Professor Waldo, I was able to begin to overcome this fear.  This has been, by far, the most rewarding class I have taken at Harvard.
amazing class! no technical background required, absolutely changes the way you think about your personal information, you will gain a new awareness.  Workload manageable, faculty will know who you are from the first week, and they are all very enthusiastic about the class and their work.
Great course, manageable courseload. Small size and lots of participation. Assignments are fun and eye-opening and directly applicable to the real world.
Really really excellent class, and one of my all-time favorites!  Prof. Waldo always has a pithy quote, Prof. Sweeney is in the middle of current privacy issues (she gets to sit in on Supreme Court cases!), and Dean Smith is the serious one who is the glue of the entire operation.  Perfect second-semester senior course - applicable to the real world, workload not ridiculous, counts for lots of things.  TAKE IT!
Take the time to prepare and participate actively in discussions to get the most out of the class.
Best class I have taken at Harvard. Engaging, fun, and entirely relevant to the real world and activities we partake in everyday. Would HIGHLY recommend anyone and everyone to apply to take this course.
Complete waste of time
This class is wonderful! The teaching staff is very friendly and engaging (Latanya Sweeney, Michael Smith, Jim Waldo) and the course material is very interesting and relevant. Especially as a non-CS major, it was amazing to learn about this entire field and all these new technologies that I never knew existed but are so important and relevant in today's world. Totally OK even if you're not a CS major (I came into the course having no knowledge of coding, never having taken another CS class). TAKE IT!!
The course is amazing and extremely applicable to life. You gain an awareness of many privacy issues that you'd never even consider beforehand (ex: how is your online activity tracked? What information is collected and sold to advertisers/ third parties about you from internet browsing, iphone use, and transaction history? Should you be concerned about how much data there is about you on the internet?) The course is also taught by an amazing set of faculty, and you get to know them through class discussions. The workload is not too much, and the small group projects are very interesting. The class will likely be capped at 30 people- this is the ideal number for discussions during lecture.
Take it!
The professors are great, and the material is really interesting. You might occasionally get bogged down by the structure or assignments, but it's worth it. It's hard to find a course that's this engaging.
good way to fulfill a CS requirement, pretty interesting, assignments could be better though
Take this class if you have the chance!  All the instructors were brilliant and great teachers (and Waldo is hilarious).  It's not too hard, but you can get a lot out of it if you do the readings and participate in discussions.  The final project, in particular, I felt was a really neat way to assimilate all the knowledge you'd gain.  Much more discussion of real-word applications and real-world discussions than you get in a typical Harvard class.  I loved it.
Its more assignments/time than you expect but really intresting and fun and a good classroom environment.
It's a really fun class. Go to lecture - they're actually interesting. It's been great to be in such a small class of 30 people where the professors get to know you well by the end of the class, so definitely apply!
Awesome class and interesting for students of any discipline.
didn't actually learn a whole lot... most of the class is everybody (professors and students both) "discussing" (i.e., wildly speculating about) privacy threats and regulations without much concrete grounding. it's also not structured very well (something the teaching staff freely admits to) which doesn't help the repetitive and unsubstantive nature of the class (sorry i know "unsubstantive" isn't a word). this subject matter had so much potential, but i came away very disappointed in what i actually learned.
This is one of the most relevant, interesting, and enjoyable classes at this school!
This is an interesting and painless way to satisfy the secondary concentration requirements in CS.  Good luck getting in!
It's an easy class and has interesting material, but the course is organized in a way to make you focus on the least interesting parts for no good reason.  The instructors seem very proud that the class is so unique, but unique doesn't always mean good.  But it's barely any work, so if you're interested in the material it might be worth taking.
Easily my favorite class at Harvard. Simple material (current news articles and the like) evolves into technical and philosophical discussions on privacy in the 21st century. Beyond the fascinating subject area, you'll also become a much better writer; the professors do not bullshit you in their constructive critiques. All in all, the class is a breath of fresh air.
Incredibly important, topical, and fascinating class. The course instructors are really engaged in the topics, and their concern/interest in the issues really showed and inspired us. The best part of this course was the interesting topics and the course heads' engaging discussions.
for everyone (since we all use technology)
It's a great course! You'll be a little behind without any background in CS even if it's not technically required because so many other people in the class are CS concentrators, but the students who take it are really interested, the professors are great and the topics are really fun.
Topics were really interesting, light work load, great teaching staff who are available to work one-on-one with students, and no section required b/c most discussion and work was done in class
CS105 was one of the most fun classes I've taken at Harvard. The professors are amazing, the content is fascinating, the students are passionate and engaged. All in all, this class will be one of my fondest memories from this year.
Great exposure to different applications of privacy to technology.
CS105 is one of those classes that draws you in completely after a while. The professors present interesting and relevant topics, and let their students come up with solutions instead of lecturing all the time.
I would tell them that it is not an easy course but it is a really fun and interesting course with great professors and cool topics to discuss.
This class is great mostly because there's no midterm or final, and the other work is really not that bad. It's a casual, awesome class to take in senior spring because it starts you to think about the real world that you are about to enter and to start thinking like a responsible adult who my not get things like a page minimum or maximum on an assignment. This class helped me start applying all the great things I've learned in other courses to the real world, and that made it very worthwhile for me.
This class can be tricky, and can certainly be a time crunch on Thursday and Friday when you do the group projects, but you would be remiss to ignore any class with such a stellar set of professors and such a relevant topic.
It's like a summer comedy, as far as courses go.  It's light and flaky, not terribly thought or work intensive.  Jim Waldo stars as the talented but goofy partner (Hutch from Starsky & Hutch; Carter from Rush Hour; the fat chick from Big Momma's House), Allan is the serious bookish guy (Starsky from Starsky & Hutch; Lee from Rush Hour; or Paul Giamatti...yeah, let's just call him Paul Giamatti).  Mike Smith does cathartic action moves at the end.  It's fun, and you might take something away at the end, but really that's up to you.
Great class with diverse students
It's a very enjoyable, easy-going class, but you will still learn a lot. The topics were so interesting that I found myself talking about them to people outside of the class. The professors are great and very approachable. I came away with a better understanding of the privacy threats from technology.
The class was interesting, but I did not come away with as strong an understanding of the issues as I had hoped.
If you want to check out a cs class at Harvard, but don't know anything about programming (or even how to get your printer to print double-sided copies) then this course is a great introduction.  You'll learn about privacy laws around the internet, as well as big events in technology that have led to questions of privacy.  It's a fun class.
I would say take it if you are interested in technology and the Internet and want a class with unique academic requirements.
not qualified to answer
This is the class that you take and tell your friends about what they're missing. It's super fun, and the assignments are a breeze since they are interesting as well!
