You are taking expos to learn how to write at the college level. This class was awesome. I loved the reading. I loved Dr. Urban. I loved the class discussion. However, what you really need to consider is whether or not it will be possible for you to really learn about college level writing from something as abstract as contemporary theatre. I would recommend taking something more concrete, such as a history based course.
Kurban is a tough grader but he knows what he's doing.  You probably won't do as well as you think you are going to do in this course.
Ken Urban is hilarious and a really great guy once you get to know him.  It is very useful to know his personality and his style when attempting to revise essays to fit his comments.
This is an excellent expos class, especially for those interested in theater. The grading is tough, but it's tough for every expos class. Ken is a phenomenal preceptor who generates a lot of enthusiasm and is super knowledgable about the plays you'll be reading. Some of the plays are sort of weird and take some unpacking, but that's what the class is for. Don't take this class if you are incredibly squeamish and/or intellectually lazy.
Especially if you like theater (but not only), this seems like a good expos to take.  I was never bored in section, and the readings were interesting.  The course is also very literary if you're not dying to do a ton of research with statistics, etc.  The grading is a little tough, but not unreasonable.
Be prepared to be critiqued and have your writing ripped apart. Don't expect that your final drafts will be really anything like your rough drafts, because they almost never are. That being said, this was probably my favorite class I've taken at Harvard so far.
Don't take this unless you have experience and/or interest in modern, existential theater! Ken is a very difficult preceptor, but gives you great guidance in the revision process. Grading is tough!
Step One: rob a bank in Now You See Me Fashion and put the money in a box. Step Two: Open said box. Step 3: Bribe the dean. Bribe the dean above said dean. Bribe the president. Bribe the U.S. president. Do all you can to avoid taking this class.
I would only recommend it if they enjoy the topic material very much.
This class will truly test your ability to reason through difficult topics in tough plays. That said, you have to take Expos, and this is one you'll enjoy. The preceptor is by no means an easy grader, and this is notorious as one of the hardest expos classes. But it is so worth the work. The plays you read are challenging but fascinating. It is not for the weak of heart or stomach, but you will finish the course feeling as though you didn't waste a course on Expos.
If it's still offered with Ken, TAKE IT!! I loved it.
For those appreciative of preceptors who find humor in sarcasm, Dr. Ken Urban is one who encourages an atmosphere of debate and argument about the plays we studied (some of which are controversial or explicit in nature). Personally, I enjoyed the discussions during class-time, though I feel that students who are more sensitive to these topics may not enjoy as much. In general, Ken gave very timely and helpful feedback on essays, as we'd always get them back in under a week, sometimes the following Monday or Tuesday. Even if your only interest in expos is to become a better writer, this class will serve that purpose and beyond. I would recommend this class to future students.
The plays for this class are interesting but the assignments can be more painful than necessary, even for expos, and the workload is heavier than most expos classes.  If you are planning on concentrating in or taking a lot of English type classes it will be useful but otherwise it was not super helpful in just general style writing.
Unless you really enjoy thinking/writing/living theatre, this is a very theatre-intensive course, and everyone else in the class will be extremely into theatre. If that's your thing, this is the expos for you.
There is an emphasis on existentialism.
The subject material can be intense and personal (for example, we read a How I Learned to Drive by Paula Vogel, a play about pedophilia), but if this is not a major problem for you, then I definitely recommend the class.
If you like theater, this is a great class for you. You get to read some very interesting plays, and meet a lot of other people in the freshman class involved in theater. Ken Urban gives great advice and is helpful through the course, but is a very harsh grader. It is good to have a strong writing background. If you are more interested in the sciences, this may be more difficult for you, as it is mostly critical analysis of literature.
This class is amazing. Do not miss out on it if you can. It will challenge your conceptions of theater and break boundaries for the better. Also, if you ever wanted to curse in a class with impunity, this one would be the one to do it in.
Expos classes are going to be tough. They have a formula for the writing process, so each different class is going to be about the same. However, the readings for this class were amazing and Ken Urban is a great instructor. If you are at all interested in theater  and no, you don't have to be a "theater kid"  then I hope you get to take this class!
You have to take Expos. With that in mind, I'd recommend this course, even if you have no background in theater. The readings, especially Units 2 and 3, are fantastic. Dr. Urban is hilarious (though not if you're easily offended, I suppose) and very knowledgeable about all the material. His feedback is somewhat vague and can be frustrating, but if you take the time to consider the questions he is asking about your draft and why he asked those, it's easy to improve your drafts. He's a fairly hard grader, but if your writing has improved and you have addressed his questions, I feel like he recognizes and acknowledges that.
Yes, the essays are graded very difficulty. Yes, it's more work and harder to do well in than other expos classes. However, you will actually enjoy going to class, and you will actually learn. As a hard sciences person, essay writing was (and still kind of is) terrifying for me, and Ken does a fantastic job making you a better analytical writer. The first unit can be a little boring, but the other plays (esp Sarah Kane), are beyond amazing. There will be all-nighters, and there will be hours spent just thinking about the difficult prompts without getting anything tangible done. I spent at least 35 hours (probably a low estimate) working on each paper, and sometimes the end grade was disheartening. But do it, because you will be one of the few to actually have enjoyed and learned through expos.
It's Expos. The writing part sucks. The readings are great and will be very interesting; however, analyzing them and formulating essays won't be fun unless you are very very very into that. That's the case for almost every Expos class, I've heard, so take it for the readings.
Ken Urban has a very specific style in which he wants his students to write, and if you write differently -- no matter what kind of feedback you have gotten from other teachers/professors or how good of a writer you consider yourself to be -- you will likely get consistently bad grades.
Very difficult material and high expectations, but extremely rewarding if you're willing to put the time and effort in to really understand both what Professor Urban is saying and what the plays are about
You have to take it; so take this one
This class isn't being offered again...
It's interesting.
Dr. Urban is a true treat. It is truly an opportunity to be taught by a recognized expert on contemporary theater and a relevant playwright of contemporary theater as Urban is.
This course is an excellent, interesting class- it may be one of the more positive expos classes out there. It is definitely challenging, and the teacher expects a lot out your writing. A fair amount of frustration and discouragement will be involved seeing your writing being assessed by your teacher and peers, but that is probably the case with most if not all the expos classes. One thing for sure is that this specific course guarantees the most you can get out of an expos class. If you're looking for an easy class to with an easily attained A, don't take this class; if you're willing to see your papers get torn apart and receive some lower grades in exchange for many lessons learned, and a surely entertaining teacher and class discussions, take this class for sure.
This class will challenge you, no doubt about it, but you will be reading incredible texts and will be excited by your 2nd and 3rd essays. The workload is extremely minimal except when you have an essay due-and then you kind of just wallow in sadness for a few days and then turn it in. Ken is a great professor, and class is very engaging. This is one of the only classes at Harvard that will allow you to read modern theater in an academic setting, and it is worth the hard work to become a better writer and expand your theatrical horizons.
