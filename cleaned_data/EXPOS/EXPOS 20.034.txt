It isn't all about the Wire, there are readings too
Be ready to think outside the box, and analyze some deep societal questions.
For expos, best seleciton by far.
If you prefer to watch and analyze a television over reading and analyzing a book, this course is for you. The material in this class is very interesting and actually matters in your life, even if you do not pursue a related field in this topic, which leads to interesting discussions. Liz is a great teacher and helps you a lot in your essays. Given, it is still an expos course, meaning the grading is skewered, but this is probably the best expos course Harvard has to offer.
Liz is a great preceptor, and the texts are interesting and pretty easy to get through. HOWEVER, don't underestimate the drawbacks of having a course advertised as being all about The Wire: a lot of people in the class are looking for an easy section and as a result means the in-class experience suffers quite a bit.
Be prepared to write a good amount and review your work more than you probably have in the past.
Fun class that will always have you interested
Although this was a wonderful Expos section, do not be fooled. It is still an Expos class. The materials are fascinating and extremely interesting, but the lack of more formal sources is not a sign that it will be easier. This class will still demand a lot of you.
very interesting class
Liz is awesome, and you really learn about the crises many cities across the world face. Probably one of the best Expos classes
