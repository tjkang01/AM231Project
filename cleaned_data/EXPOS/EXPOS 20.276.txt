The course material and the preceptor's individual feedback were quite interesting and helpful. Class time was spent more discussing American Criminality, and less writing. I enjoyed the discussions, but when writing papers felt I could have had more instruction.
For an Expos course, it's not that hard. It also improved my writing significantly.
Lindsay is great, and this class has more interesting writing assignments than other expos flavors. Definitely a good choice.
take advantage of the conference draft thing, great comments, great conferences
As expos classes go, this one isn't bad.
This class maybe good for an expos class but you will improve your writing little.
You just have to take it and there isn't much of a choice here
Just get through it. Expos is rough, but you'll make it.
American Criminals is such an awesome class! The content is very engaging and the preceptor is super nice and helpful!
It is barely about criminals
