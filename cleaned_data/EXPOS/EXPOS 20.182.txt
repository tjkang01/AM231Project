It's not history-oriented. I thought it would be, but it's not very sociological. It's more geared towards literature and artistic platforms expressive of Boston. So I guess the title of the course if spot on.
This course is definitely manageable and Dr. Becker is a great preceptor. Dr. Becker is very enthusiastic and thoroughly interested in her students, which overall really enhances the course. You learn a great amount about writing, how to effective argue a point, and how to incorporate close reading into your analysis to make your supporting evidence stronger. The materials we use, especially the films we study for Unit 2, are also very interesting.

This class is great!  I thoroughly enjoyed my expos experience, and Dr. Becker is a sweetheart.  Just be aware that this course deals more with the arts and humanities, which may not be explicitly clear.
Great essay topics
Though the subject matter may seem interesting, it is not presented in the most engaging of ways.
You don't actually learn anything about Boston.
