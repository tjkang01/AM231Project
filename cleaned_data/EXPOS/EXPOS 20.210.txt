Expos isn't the greatest course at Harvard and because it's so standardized the preceptor can make or break a course. And Jonah Johnson makes this course. He's awesome!
Having only taken one Expos course I shouldn't compare, but from what I've heard and experienced this might be the best one. Jonah is hilarious, my writing and analytical skills improved exponentially, and the work is manageable. If Jonah taught any other courses here I would already be enrolled.
Jonah is an amazing teacher, and the class serves as an excellent survey of classical and modern tragedy. Tended to be a lot of reading, but it felt worth it.
Jonah is a very relaxed professor and you can generally get away without doing your homework. His lectures can be a little boring and difficult to focus on, but he is a fun and interesting character. He gives good feedback and is not excessively harsh.
it's sick, bro
Jonah is a great teacher, you learn a lot about your writing, and you read good books. What's not to like?
TAKE THIS CLASS. So many people gripe about their Expos experience, but I can honestly say it was a highlight of my semester. Jonah is an incredible teacher and person, and you will learn so much more than the mere nuts and bolts of writing conventions. By no means is this class on tragedy depressing--Jonah's wit and what you learn about the true meaning of this classic literary form keep the class lively.
The preceptor is awesome, and he is really helpful during the writing process. This was honestly one of my favorite classes this semester even though it is Expos.
Definitely take this expos.  Jonah is a fantastic preceptor, and the readings were short and easy compared to what I heard about other expos courses.  But the main reason you should take this is because Jonah is so great and helpful.
