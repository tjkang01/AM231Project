definitely take this class. I heard nightmare stories about expos and I really enjoyed this course
Tad's section is great, and you will learn a lot about writing and structuring your ideas, even if you are coming from a strong writing background. The emphasis during class time is on the writing process and writing techniques, not on democracy and government. The writing assignments are interesting and enjoyable, and you'll be doing a lot less reading than other expos classes, which gives you more time to focus on the writing. Consequently, Tad's expectations for your papers are higher than they might be in many other expos classes, but this will help your writing.
Especially if you have an interest in politics, the political-focus of the course is interesting and makes the writing aspect of the course easier and accessible.
Best expos class by far - painless and interesting. Tad is the MAN!
It prepared my to write and revise with confidence in future college courses and brought my writing to the next level in just one semester.
Taking this class was extremely enjoyable. Tad is a truly wonderful instructor, and the atmosphere in class was always very encouraging and rewarding. I strongly recommend this class. Possibly one of the best expos classes you could hope to get!
Tad is a great professor and the material is so interesting.  I have no reservations about taking this course.
-very good professor -the topics you get to look at are very interesting
The class is very interesting but the instructor is not prompt with getting work back to you. However, it's one of the best expos classes that I've heard about.
Professor Davies makes the course and the material very interesting and enjoyable.
