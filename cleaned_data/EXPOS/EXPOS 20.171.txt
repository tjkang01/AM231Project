It's a fun Expos topic, and with Dr. Becker teaching it, as long as you put in the time and take class and her advice seriously, you'll do well and your writing will significantly improve.
the first primary source for Essay 1 can be challenging
You have to take it. The opportunity cost is huge with all the other amazing courses at Harvard but Boston in Words and Images is a good class In the context of expos and I would definitely take it over most of the others.
Seems like a fun class but is a lot of work.
This course is unlikely to help your writing skills, though, you do get to watch some cool movies
This class is very interesting and Dr.Becker is a very caring, helpful teacher.
Don't take it just because you get to watch movies
Definitely one of the more enjoyable Expos classes from what I can tell. We watch movies, read one novella, and do a smattering of readings. The homework for this class was minimal, and the assignments are most like the essays you'll actually write for humanities/social science classes you'll take later. Dr. Becker gives great feedback and is really friendly. She's very good at diagnosing where you're having trouble in your essay and in helping you figure out how to fix it.
Dr. Becker made this Expos class. If she isn't teaching it, no promises.
