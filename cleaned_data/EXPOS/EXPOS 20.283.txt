This course is actually an applicable and interesting class, which is a hard overlap in searching for course that also fulfill a graduation requirement.
This class had the feel of both a law course and an ethics course. I did not really expect the legal part but I definitely enjoyed it.
I would highly recommend this class. I found the subject both interesting and informative. 
The readings are very reasonable and engaging while providing the necessary information without being too long or complex. The instructor is approachable, moderates class discussion well, and provides thoughtful feedback for each of your drafts and papers.
If you have an interest in surveillance and/or government policy, you should definitely take this course. And even if not, this is still a great Expos to take.
Take it if you're interested in the topic
most of the focus in this course is on the law side, with little room in the papers to speak on the technological parts of the topic.
This class is definitely one of the more interesting expos classes, and allows you to learn about relevant information.
This is an awesome course! It's the perfect Expos course, with light reading. The material is interesting and highly relevant to the world we live in, and it really prepares you to think critically about the NSA's surveillance program. Dr. Sinnott is great at guiding the conversation, and remains perfectly neutral so that ideas free flowly among her students. She's also got an awesome posh Irish accent!
If you're already a good writer, this is a great and interesting way to fulfill the Expos requirement.  If you're not, it is still extremely interesting subject material, but your grade will take approximately single letter grade drop.
Gillian is a wonderful instructor, and although she is new to teaching, she is an incredibly warm and sweet lady who will try her best to help you through the writing process.
