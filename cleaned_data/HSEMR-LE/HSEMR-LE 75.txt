If you've got any interest in Islam whatsoever, take this course!
Really interesting course. Provides introduction to theology of Islam while also using the lens of current events (and great mix between the two). Lots of flexibility to focus on aspects you find interesting. Engaging format (ex cool reading response prompts).
This course is extremely interesting! Bilal does a fantastic job of encouraging discussion on a number of interesting topics. I highly recommend taking this course!
(Mis)Understanding Islam is a great class to be a part of. This was the first year it was taught, so I do not know what changes will be made. It challenged us to reflect on media, our understanding of Islam, and different controversies from an Islamic perspective. Definitely a low-stress environment to learn about important issues and grow as a person.
