The grading is harsh, you learn something that is obvious and does not enhance your knowledge at all. I have some prior experience before this though. Honestly, it was not a memorable class.
This class is unorganized and the lecturing sporadic. The assignments are unclear and graded slightly harshly.
The lectures could have been summarized into a single page of bullets, often lacked in substance, and were overly opinionated to the point that it was hard to accept the information presented.. Lectures usually didn't bring in substantive support and completely lacked in countering arguments or evidence. However, the lectures taught by the TF were marvelous.
Take this course! It's a great way to understand basics of environmental health without having to know the intricate science behind it. Learned a lot from the current topics we covered and the professor is very enjoyable and kind. A great elective course!
This course is a great way to explore issues that often get given lots of media attention, e.g. pesticide use and air pollution, thus giving you a better idea of the true knowledge/science behind the problem. Very useful to think about the problems we face across the world, not just in the US.
It was a small class and you really get to learn about current public health problems. The guest lectures were also great and inspiring, and showed how they were improving public health with their initiatives.
