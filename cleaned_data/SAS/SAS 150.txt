An absolutely wonderful class. Prof. Eck is brilliant and warm and the course felt intimate and scholarly. A definite highlight includes traveling to India to see our research take shape and our questions answered in the field.
This class has so much potential, but needs serious organization and planning. But I don't blame the professors as material and data on the Kumbh Mela is very hard to come by.
If any type of class like this is ever offered again, take it.  Diana Eck is the best professor I will ever have.
Professors Eck and Mehrotra did a great job of tying it all together and keeping the audience engaged for a full two hours. Given the infrequency of the Kumbh Mela I don't know when or if this class will be offered again but I would definitely recommend it because it exposed students to the interdisciplinary complexities involved in planning and managing a pilgrimage of this scale.
take it again in 12 years!
Fun and unconventional!
Awesome class-- a little disorganized but cool in that you can study whatever you want about the pilgrimage and get to interact with some of the most knowledgeable people on issues related to Hinduism and modern India.
