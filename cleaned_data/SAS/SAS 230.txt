Prof. Amrith is not only a extremely knowledgeable scholar about the subject matter but also a wonderfully encouraging teacher.  He would walk us through the readings page by page, highlighting critical passages and concepts before challenging us to develop our own intellectual responses.  The small class size is also another highlight of the course, and I feel I learned as much from my peers as from the course materials.
This is an amazing class. Professor Amrith is greatdefinitely one of the most extraordinary thinkers at Harvard. Take this class if you're interested in history or the environment, or both!
This course is a terrific introduction to major themes in the environmental history of South Asia. The syllabus may be adjusted according to student interest. Professor Amrith is a stellar discussion facilitator, exceptionally supportive and frequently incisive.
This class was a memorable introduction to Environmental History in India. Sunil motivates class discussions well, and the small class size encourages all kinds of wide ranging discussions, especially since he is quite open minded and willing to take the class in many different discussions.
