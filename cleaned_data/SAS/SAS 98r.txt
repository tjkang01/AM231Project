Most fun I've had in a class at Harvard! There were only three of us in this tutorial, as it was the first time it was run, and we had incredibly substantive debates that I genuinely looked forward to. James is the man. The material is kind of mind-blowing, if you're willing to put time into it. If you've ever been curious about non-Western philosophy I absolutely recommend this class!
Prof. Amrith is an incredibly kind person and a walking encyclopedia when it comes to South Asia--I can't recommend doing your SAS junior tutorial with him highly enough!
