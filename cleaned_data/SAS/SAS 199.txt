Shankar ji is great! Do the readings because they really aid to class discussion. If you don't read then class is more or less pointless. Readings can take a lot of hours so start ahead.
You read a book every week so make sure you are able to plan your time accordingly. Also make sure you get a copy of the books well ahead of time. I didn't want to buy all of the books, because there are so many, but these books are mostly unknown and very hard to locate. Make sure you have  a copy of the book at the beginning of each week so you have time to read it and write a response by the end of the week.
If you want to get a better understanding of Modern India, then this will be the best selection of readings from some of the best novels and short stories you'll ever find.
