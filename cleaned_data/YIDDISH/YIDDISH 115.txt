You'll probably not understand much if you aren't Jewish...it's a good class with an interesting professor and low workload, but it is a little bit of academic hand-waving. Not sure how much I learned.
This class is fabulous. Professor Zaritt is a doll, his lectures are interesting, and he is invested in amplifying student voices. The readings are interesting and have a common theme throughout, giving a real structure to the course, and the assignments and grading are fair. I cannot recommend enough.
