Great class if you're interested in DRB!
Get ready to work with a lot of different model organisms, especially mice!
It`s a good class that gives you exposure to a number of faculty, animal models and research approaches in the developmental biology field. Useful to meet potential advisors or inspire you with ideas. It gives a very good overview of where the field generally stands. It`s more basic science orientated so not the most appropriate if you are more interested in regenerative medicine.
It's a good introduction to a variety of potential thesis labs.
BEST COURSE EVER
Wonderful class!
