If you are interested in developmental and regenerative biology, this is a great primer. After this, you can decide which field you'd like to dig further
Almost everyday you will see some exciting research you have never seen before.
It is great class for students that had like to explore new and exciting research areas.
If you're at all interested in developmental and regenerative biology, this course is a great way to get exposure to the field and see firsthand how the research in done in the lab.
This course is a great opportunity to explore different DRB research across the campuses.
The best part of the course is getting exposure to a range of topics and model organisms in developmental biology.
The concept behind the course is compelling: exposure to techniques and concepts in several DRB labs, and perhaps a path into a third rotation if you found a lab you loved. In practice, I didn't take much away from the course. The quality of the sessions varied a lot lab to lab, especially the hands-on component.
Overall totally worthwhile. Lab component can be very tedious at times but useful as well.
