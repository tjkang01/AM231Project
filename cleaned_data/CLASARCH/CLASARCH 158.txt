Excellent for any interested undergraduate or graduate who would like a crash course in the study of ancient sculpture.
Professor Staehli is a great teacher and is very knowledgable. The first half of the course was a comprehensive, chronological overview of Greek sculpture, while the second half was a discussion of Roman "copies." The second half included student presentations, which were all very thorough and interesting, but very lengthy, taking up nearly the entire weekly class period on a weekly basis.
Professor Staehli's courses are the best, and this was no exception!
A fantastic class with an incredibly knowledgeable professor. Keeping up with the work and the reading is a must if you want to feel on top of the class.
