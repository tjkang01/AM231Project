Wonderful course, especially if you are interest in Greek mythology and art history. Be prepared to discuss in class, as the discussions are valuable for everyone in the class. This was a great investigation of archaeology and art history as they pertain to Greek myths, and I highly recommend the course.
Prof. Staehli brings ancient art to life in a really inspiring way. He opens up so many questions about how to view and interpret ancient art objects. I strongly recommend this class for anyone with an interest in ancient greek art - or art in general! - as well as history, literature, archaeology.
This course allows for a lot of flexibility in terms of exploring what you're interested in. I would highly recommend a background in classical studies, especially Homeric epics, and being fluent in German helps too. Pretty low-stress course with just a presentation and final paper, and the readings throughout the course aren't too demanding. Prof. Staehli is fantastic and very knowledgeable--definitely utilize him as a resource!
This class is fun and interesting.
