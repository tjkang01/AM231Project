I definitely recommend this course. It has an interesting topic, great reading materials, and engaging discussions in class. Plus, Professor Staehli is very nice and helpful. Great class in general.
This course is great, a small seminar with lots of freedom to pursue the aspects of collecting and museums that appeal to you personally. Highly recommend.
