I highly recommend the class! Professor Hankins is a very knowledgeable person and especially on this topic. I learned so much and the sources we read are very interesting. This class changed the way I think in a good way. I would definitely take the class.
Professor Hankins is a world authority on the Renaissance, and this class covers a lot of the questions currently being debated in the field. Though it is a graduate seminar, it is a wonderful, accessible introduction to the Renaissance, especially the thought of Petrarch.
