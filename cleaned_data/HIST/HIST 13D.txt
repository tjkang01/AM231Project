If you want a genuinely rich academic experience - which includes not only gathering what is probably new information but also really grappling with the presentation of that information - in an inclusive and open didactic space, I highly recommend you take courses with either of these instructors. This class is what a true academic community ough tto look like.
Professor Nahmabadi is very knowledgeable about her field, but the class needs more concrete guiding questions
I loved this class, and I couldn't recommend it more if you are interested in Middle Eastern history. Beware however, that it is helpful to have some rough knowledge of 20th century Iranian history, or at least about America's involvement in Iran.
This course is a lot of work, but is worth it if you are interested in the subject! The instructor is really knowledgable and is able to give a first hand account of a lot of the topics discussed.
It really opens your eyes to the struggles of other countries
