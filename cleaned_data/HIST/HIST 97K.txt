This class really depends on "who" you get as your professor and teaching staff. Luckily, mine were fantastic, and I enjoyed my time working them. However, I know others who were in the history tutorial who did have as great experiences. Additionally, try to actually do the readings for your course - it makes class discussion far richer than if you've merely skimmed them. A lot of readings you do are irrelevant to the final paper (as far as content is concerned), but you do learn the "skill" of writing history through these pieces you read.
This is a requirement, but I would greatly recommend history as a concentration.
You don't have a choice if you're a concentrator. Sorry.
The small group component of the class is great and you'll get a lot of really helpful feedback on your writing. However, the long full-group sessions are really long and boring.
You have to take a 97, so you might as well take social history.  Professor Chalhoub is a gem, and it is obvious that he really cares about his students.  That being said, the readings assigned in this course are almost entirely unrelated to your assignments because of the nature of this course, so it almost feels like two separate classes.  If you want to do well, go to every office hours with your TF.  It helps.
put effort in corrections
all hist concentrators have to take, but i actually enjoyed it
