excellent professorinteresting close reading of 19th cen novel of Machado via Flaubertmust take course
Definitely take this course. Professor Chalhoub is wonderful. His enthusiasm for the course will make you get excited too! The novels are very interesting and unlike any other books I have read. The course changed the way I think in a good way and expanded my views on what constitutes history and literature. Overall, an interesting, fun, and thought-provoking class. I highly recommend.
Learning from Prof Chalhoub is a treat. He's very sweet, accommodating, and knowledgable. You can't help but get excited about the course material.
Prof. Chalhoub is one of the best professors I have met during my time at Harvard. If you are interested in Brazilian culture and history, you should definitely take a class with him.
Take this class to discover a wonderful author who has been neglected for too long. Professor Chalhoub is a world authority on Machado de Assis, and his historiographical commentary on the novels made me discover a whole new Brazil.
