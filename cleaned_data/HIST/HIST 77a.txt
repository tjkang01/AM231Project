It is one of those classes that teach you more about Africa than conventional thematic courses!
It was extremely enjoyable. Great professor for a seminar. I really liked the way we rotated and had a different student lead every week.
It is a really specific topic so it's good if you are interested in African social history and anthropology.
I would say that this class has no structure and that it does not accurately fit the criterion of a reading seminar.  I would say that this class is not a reasonable class to take because the subject is too specific and therefore the reading gets boring after about week three.
Very interesting subject matter and original
