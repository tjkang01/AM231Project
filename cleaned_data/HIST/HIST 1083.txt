This class is fine. Sarna is great, but you have to like the material.
This class is awesome! Sarna is an amazing speaker, and you'll really enjoy lecture. I thought I knew a lot about American Jewish history, but I learned so much from this class. Take it!!!
Yes. It was excellent. The material was very interesting and the professor was helpful and really talented at discussing the material and explaining it that was memorial and helpful. I would take any class with professor Sarna again.
Sarna is the world's authority on this topic. His passion and knowledge are inspirational, and the course is informative and interesting.
You will know everything about American Jewry.
