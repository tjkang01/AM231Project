Unfortunately, Professor Deloria was a visiting professor. Harvard should definitely get a specialist in American Indian history.
I wish we had more classes like this that focused on Native American history/ studies. Thanks to Professor Deloria for an incredible semester!
This class will change how you think about American history.  You learns so much from not only the books and professor, but also your peers.  I know this sounds corny, but it was just so perfect a class
This class is an incredible opportunity to learn from one of the best American Indian historians in the world. It was fascinating and the research paper was fantastic. Be warned you have to read a ton.
A great and intensive course that will teach you how to write a research paper
Take it to learn about Americas origins from a unique outlook.
This was such an incredible course! I loved showing up everyday, and felt I came away from class with a deeper understanding of the history of American Indian people, as well as a deeper understanding of my own identity.
