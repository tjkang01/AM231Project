This class is necessary and important. It is in a stage of being redesigned from being more theoretically focused to being more practically oriented. The pre-professional parts of the course will be useful down the line, if not right now.
This course provides useful resources and materials for TFs while recognizing that we are busy people. The discussions and guest speakers were productive, and I used a lot of the suggestions from this class in my teaching.
