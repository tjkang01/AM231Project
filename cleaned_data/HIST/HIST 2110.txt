Lots of freedom in terms of what you read and write.
This class is perfect for those who are self-motivated.  You can get away with doing little work, but Prof. Ozment is also very generous with his time and knowledge, so he can always provide extra materials and point you in the direction of more information to supplement the course work.
A lot of fun, though have some interest in the topic...
