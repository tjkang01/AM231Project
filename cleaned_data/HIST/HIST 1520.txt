Professor Herzog is a very good teacher, values your opinion, and does not assign too much work. A very basic overview of Latin America and Spanish and Portuguese influence, but if you have always wanted to know about it I'd recommend it. Lastly, the workload, which consisted 3 papers and a midterm, was VERY manageable.
This is a "big ideas" class. Some people in class loved it. Unfortunately, I was really disappointed that this class talked about a really small number of the most important historical events in colonial Latin America, even the ones that related to the big ideas we were discussing all semester, and that it treated Latin America more or less as a monolithic set of examples of Spanish colonization. I would have loved more regional differentiation!
Very worthwhile and the easiest class I've taken at Harvard. The readings are brief and interesting and the professor has a great sense of humor. She conducts class as a discussion-lecture, making it engaging and interesting, and turns every conception of how to view the past on its head. I learned a lot and did very little work.
This is one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard: well-organized, well-taught and the skills you acquire in this class (such as close readings of primary materials, focusing on formulating interesting questions) are relevant for academic study more widely.
