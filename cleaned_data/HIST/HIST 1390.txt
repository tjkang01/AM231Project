It's low workload and an interesting opportunity to get a long overview of an important theme. You won't learn that much, and the class is fairly disjointed, but it's interesting. Very good professor
This course causes you think about the democracies we live in.
Professor Keyssar is awesome. Also, I really enjoyed the format of the course as being part lecture, part discussion. A lot of reading, and I would certainly encourage reading all of it (especially the professor's book!)
