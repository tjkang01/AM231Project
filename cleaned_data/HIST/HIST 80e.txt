The research paper you write at the end of the term will take over your life.  However, Professor McCormick is great, and will make time to see you after class (or on Skype).  He gives you a lot of feedback, as does the TF, and both are extremely helpful.  With the paper, you will learn a lot about a very specific subject because you will be researching a ridiculous amount of material about it.
awesome class. Workload kinda heavy but class and section fun! A big commitment but worth it!
The course is a lot of work, but definitely worth it. It is actually less work than Professor McCormick's lecture courses, since there's no midterm or final exam. It's an excellent opportunity to get to work with one of Harvard's best professors in an intimate environment and get to work with the latest discoveries is history and archaeology.
Working with McCormick is the closest you'll get to an intellectual fairy godparent who is aware of your potential as a historian and seeks to guide you to the point when that potential is fulfilled. It's a rigorous exercise with indescribable pay-off.
The course uses interesting source material and on the cutting edge of research about the Roman Empire. The professor is also very charismatic. The readings are way too much (sometimes they were around 200-300 pages per week), and the short assignments along the way can be frustrating.
This class is no joke. It is the real thing. One gets to be among the first people to learn about ongoing research projects concerning Late Antique Gaul. Mr. McCormick is a fascinating professor. Also, this course does not only provide with a lot of information about the fall of Rome and late antiquity in Gaul, but it also teaches you how to really write a good research paper.
Expectations are certainly high, but this is without a doubt the best class I have taken at Harvard.
