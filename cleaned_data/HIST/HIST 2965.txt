The readings, and in my group the discussions as well, were skewed toward European history.  But the methodological and theoretical aspects of the readings were interesting and useful for anyone.
This was a wonderful course on how to apply different scopes (i.e. transnational, global, oceanic, microhistorical) to the pursuit of historical investigation. Challenging and rewarding. Excellent reading. Highly recommended.
This course provides the informed methodological discussion and reading that the 3900 course never delivers.
Be ready to engage with your peers in a meaningful, constructive way. Read closely and ask specific questions, and you'll get the most out of the texts and the course.
There is quite a bit of reading, and a wide range of topics, some of which may be unfamiliar, are covered.
I believe this is a must-take for someone studying history. It pushes you to think the diverse materials carefully, to engage thoughtful and meaningful dialogues with both the professor and your fellow students.
This class was a wonderful instruction in historical research, particularly for its quite practical, specific, and concrete approach to historical method.
