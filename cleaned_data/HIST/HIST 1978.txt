Good balance of theory and practice.
This is an exquisitely well run course. The material is fascinating, the discussions are engaging, and the instructors were remarkably good.
You should take this and any other class taught by Diana Kim and Kirsty Walker! You will learn a lot in a relaxed atmosphere that puts the emphasis on the learning.
It's a super interesting conference course. The readings are ~80 pages per week, the diary entries are fun to do almost, and the research paper is manageable.
