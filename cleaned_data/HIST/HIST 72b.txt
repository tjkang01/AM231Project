Look at the syllabus. If all the articles are still from the '80s and '90s, don't bother taking it. But the class had potential and, if the syllabus has been updated, it could be one of the better introductions to museums and display that we have here, and, either way, it will expose you to a range of questions and considerations that you have probably not had a chance to think deeply about.
This is a great course for students interested in museums and their history, as well as for history concentrators who want to fulfill their reading seminar requirement while learning about cultural history.
