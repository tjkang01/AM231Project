Students should be very motivated to do all of the readings for this course, and to help bolster class discussions. It is impossible to get by in this class by "skimming" the class readings.
Take this class.  You will not regret it.  The professor is very friendly and the class, if the same, is very conductive to intellectual growth and scholarly discourse in way that is not intimidating.
This course provides students with an opportunity to work closely with an excellent, dedicated professor and to conduct guided original research on a fascinating topic. The course is especially useful for students in the humanities who are interested in learning more about research methods and the process of writing a research paper. Finally, the subject matter - women in medieval and early modern Europe - is interesting and allows for students to study a wide variety of both conventional and untraditional historical sources. I would recommend this course with enthusiasm!
It's a fun course with a manageable workload, but you really need to do the readings.  Much of the class is discussion-based, and you will sit there awkwardly in class if you do not do the readings.
Prof. Greenblatt is a great teacher, and really takes care of students.
The professor has a wonderful approach to the course readings, but you really have to engage with them if you want to keep up. The paper-writing process in this class is the best part - you will have plenty of help every step of the way.
