The sensibly structured reading, the enthusiasm of the other students, and Prof. Rothschild's astonishing knowledge of the subject combined to make this an extremely rewarding course.
Take this class only if you really care about the 18th century and want to make sure everyone knows it.
You should choose your topic of the final paper asap.
If you have a topic for research in mind that fits with the themes of this course, it is an invaluable experience. Otherwise, it might be unfamiliar yet still intellectually exciting ground.
Take a class with Professor Rothschild.
This course explores a wide range of approaches to the history of ideas and would be useful for students working in any area of intellectual history, imperial history, legal history, or early modern Europe. There is great latitude for choosing a research topic--it is helpful to come in with an idea and begin working on the paper early in the semester.
