This was an absolutely fantastic course. Discussing 20th century popular culture helped me understand the past and present far better than I did before, and brought to my attention new arguments about the representation of different cultures and peoples in North American media. The assignments allow students to write about whatever most interests them (I used horror films for my final project), so this class can be relevant to other class you may be taking. The workload isn't unreasonable, as long as you set aside an appropriate amount of time each week for the films (which are, on the whole, very good).
