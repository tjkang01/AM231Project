This class provides a great survey of European Legal History.  Though many law school students also take the class, it is by no means inaccessible to undergraduates, and the workload was very reasonable.  Professor Herzog is so funny and very well-versed in the material.  Definitely take this course if you have a passing interest!
Do well on the midterm, not a lot of grades for this class
This course will give you a new perspective on the role of law in history. Professor Herzog is extremely knowledgeableand committed to teaching ("lecture" is more of a discussion," she reads and comments on all exams/papers).
Devote time to doing the readings, at least of the primary texts. Makes the class much more worth it.
This class was an excellent introduction to the history of European law. No prior background is necessary, and Professor Herzog is amazing! The "lectures" (more like seminars than anything) and readings were very interesting and informative. The exam were reasonable and the research paper was actually fun. It was a  very comprehensive class - you'll definitely get a lot from it. Five stars!
A solid introduction to legal history and historical debates on the law. Professor Herzog is a good lecturer and very accessible outside of class. Workload is quite manageable, but you still learn a lot by doing the "bare bones" reading.
This is a fascinating class in which you will both learn the basic outlines of a broad swath of European history and learn a significant amount of legal history.
