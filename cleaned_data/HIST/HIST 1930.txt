This class is amazing. Prof. Chalhoub is astonishingly knowledgeable and thoroughly invested in his students. Fair warning though, this is basically a literature class masquerading as a history class, but that's precisely why I loved it. If you're looking for a history-heavy course, this is not it. If you're looking for thoughtful, historically-informed discussions about Brazilian literature with one of its preeminent scholars (who also happens to be incredibly sweet and kind), then take this class!
Sidney is an amazing professor. By far one of the best professors I've ever had at Harvard. He is extremely knowledgeable and the material for the course was great. The book selection was great; very enjoyable. This course gives you a great perspective into one of Brazil's greatest authors.
Take this class! It is not necessary to have a background in Brazil, and if you have any interest in reading great Brazilian novels but don't have any Portuguese abilities, this class is for you! Of course, it is also a great class even if you have a a very strong background in Brazil, as many of the students in the course did. Basically take it no matter what. It is more of a history and literature class than a  history class, and most of the class is focused on close reading of the books we read and weekly discussions. (class this semester was quite small, just 6 people and a couple auditors which was really nice!) The work load is definitely not overwhelming, and Professor Chalhoub is very understanding and wants all of his students to succeed. One of my favorite courses at Harvard!
