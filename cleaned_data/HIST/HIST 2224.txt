This class is very low work load and we had some interesting conversations. If you like a clear road map and structure it might not be for you as this course is as much about figuring out what a class on ancestry could be about than it is about the subject matter itself. Keep in mind that it's also a class about how to teach. This is not a conventional seminar course.
Take it for Prof. Jasanoff. She is BRILLIANT and so passionate about teaching.
Great exercise in pedagogy
This class explores the topic from a wide range of vantage points and can be very fulfilling if you take the trouble to wrestle with each approach.
This class was a great experience and gave fantastic insight into the challenges that professors face. Being in class with Professor Jasanoff is always a great deal of fun (and is  quite challenging!), and I think the topic of ancestry is an important one to explore and to understand.
