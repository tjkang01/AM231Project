You should expect to do a lot of reading
It will require a lot of work to get a lot from this class, but it is a great opportunity to learn a lot about a new, important topic.
Prof Bose is a very intelligent man and a pleasure to listen to. The course itself is very eye-opening in the way it deconstructs communalism in South Asia.
You should have a fairly strong background in south asia to take this course.
This is a fun class that contextualizes tensions, both religion and region-center, in 19th and 20th century South Asia.
It's a good course, but you must do the readings. Otherwise, the discussion aspect of the course falls flat.  Even if you do the readings, however, the professor may just talk on and on, not giving you a chance to participate.
