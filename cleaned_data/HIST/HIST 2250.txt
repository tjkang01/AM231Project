As a student from a different field you need to work harder.....
Prof Maier's range of knowledge on the subject is dizzying, and he is an excellent seminar leader. Take this course/any other seminar he offers.
This course is a great opportunity for students focusing on 20th c. European history to learn the major historiographical debates in the field. I would also recommend it for students outside European history who have time for an additional elective, because many of the course themes (the nature of "modernity", structural vs. intentionalist approaches, the role of ideology in politics) apply to 20th c. history more generally.
