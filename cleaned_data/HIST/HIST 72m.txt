One of the most interesting courses I have taken at Harvard.
Julia is very passionate about teaching and excellent at utilizing creative methods to help students stay engaged.
This is an excellent course.  The readings are interesting and well selected to give you a good comparative view of everyday life in Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy, the Soviet Union, and East Germany.  Discussions in class were great, and Julia Timpe does a very good job of encouraging and directing discussion.
This course is the best.  You get to find out about people's ordinary lives under totalitarian governments.  It is a fair amount of work, and extremely interesting material, and Julia is a great instructor.
Take it to understand 20th century dictatorships better but also how everyday life history can be a great tool for analyzing historical trends and events.
Professor Timpe is so kind and approachable. I definitely recommend going to talk to her about papers and assignments ahead of time because she's great at clarifying expectations.
