Because the level of engagement with student work is rather high in this course,  the most successful students for this course will be self-driven and independent thinkers.
I would only recoment
I would say that the majority of the work of this class is about learning how to share space with more established, more experienced scholars who know a lot more of the professional "game" than you do. This is very important, and at times it can feel like diving into a deep end of a pool when you have only read about how to swim in books. But then you figure out that you can do it!
