This class is interesting as a chance to read and discuss much of the important work done in environmental history. Though taught by a scholar of Japan, readings (in part due to the history of the field) focus mostly on Europe and the United States. Discussions were usually relatively productive.
An excellent course for students inquiring about environmental history. Will get an opportunity to survey a wide range of topics. Professor is very devoted to his students & class discussions, and gives a great deal of support in the learning experience.
This class is appropriate for those with a specific interest in environmental history, and perhaps in popular writing on the environment as well. It is fairly demanding.
The instructor is a true credit to Harvard's History Department as a teacher. He is endlessly encouraging and inexhaustibly optimistic. He knows the material extremely well and is willing to push students to come to grips with the nuances of the books he teaches--he disdains straw men. The other good thing about this class is more a matter of luck than design. The students in this particular class were extremely knowledgeable, perceptive, critical, and creative thinkers.
This class produced a lot of very useful discussion about driving theoretical issues in environmental history. It was less useful in terms of exploring specific topics or methodologies.
Effective coverage of a cutting edge historical field, with an enthusiastic professor and engaging (though quite substantial) readings.
Excellent seminar and introduction to global environmental history. The professor's enthusiasm is contagious. It is quite a bit of reading and the weekly responses require a significant amount of time, but it's well worth it.
I came to the class with little background in environmental history and left as a convert.  Take it -- it will be an eye-opening experience.
