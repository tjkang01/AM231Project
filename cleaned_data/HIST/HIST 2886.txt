It is a joy to learn from Professor Mottahedeh.
History 2886 is a wonderful course.  Professor Mottahedeh's teaching style is absolutely lovely (as well as highly informative), and the course readings provide fantastic insight into medieval Islamic political and intellectual history.
Professor is wonderful, class is great.  Unlikely to be a syllabus and class will move in directions unexpected, but overall a wonderful experience.
I would tell students that a lot of the reading material is very interesting in the class and Professor Mottahedeh has a lot of knowledge to share on these and related matters. He is an encyclopedia of knowledge and if he is able to, he is willing to help in office hours. It would be ideal if he could lecture and teach more, because a good portion of the class includes a student presenting, but he will sometimes provide his input or provide useful references and information about related issues in the middle of the presentation, which is good.
