It is a very useful class to take as a graduate student, being able to work with others throughout the semester on a research project was very informative and fulfilling. I learned a lot about everyone's topic, and really valued receiving and giving feedback. It was a supportive environment, and people were genuinely trying to help everyone along with their work.
Excellent preparation for writing dissertation chapters.
I would absolutely recommend this class to someone with a clear project and a desire to dive into research and writing. Do not take the class if you don't have the time to dedicate to it. It's a lot of work, but worth it!
If you plan to take this class as a first year student you should probably not take another seminar at the same time. The workload was such that working on this class was the main thing I did all semester. That's probably fine because I did work which will almost certainly tie into my dissertation and future academic career. However, people thinking of taking the course should be forewarned.
Offers an opportunity to think critically about a focused research question and to experiment with methods, theory, etc. encountered in grad school.
