Though sometimes I found this course overly formal and sometimes mildly unwelcoming, I learned a great deal reading and hearing about the work of the Fellows and strongly recommend the experience.
great and unusual opportunity to work closely with a professor on an original piece of research over the course of an entire year.
Having three professors and six fellows was a huge advantage, a great learning experience.
