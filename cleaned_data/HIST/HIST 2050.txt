Excellent introduction to medieval historiography
I can't recommend this class enough. It will change how you think about your work and your field, no matter what it is.
Dan provokes lively discussions, gives helpful assignments, generates thought-provoking questions, and encourages reflection on your own work and on work in the field more widely. This is a fantastic class.
This class does not teach the details of medieval European history, which are readily available in any textbook.  Instead, this course teaches students how to think about issues in the writing of medieval European history and how the field itself has changed over time.  Anyone more interested in critical thinking than memorization should definitely take this class.
This class is not for beginners -- it provides a high level discussion about metahistory: thinking about history as a discipline, and not so much about the content. If you want to learn about "what really happened in the Middle Ages," this class is not in any way for you.
