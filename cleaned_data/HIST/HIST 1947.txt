Perfect for anyone with with an interest in or whose research focuses on material culture in the early Middle Ages.
This was a class I'd recommend to anyone interested in medieval history. I thought its emphasis on archaeological evidence was its strength. Professor Loveluck gives good lectures that provide a balanced overview of the topics we discuss The only reason not to take this course would be if you have worked with archaeology or material cultures before, and you are certain that you prefer working with more traditional textual sources. Also, a note about the assignments: Many Harvard classes teach a topic broadly and then expect you to choose something quite specific for your research paper, like one ruler or one episode in history. Papers for this class still let you choose one topic or theme, but then expected you to give an overview of that.
Prof. Loveluck is an incredible instructor. It's astounding how much he knows about the material and how good he is at explaining it.
This was a wonderful class!  Prof. Loveluck is AMAZING and presented really interesting material in class.  The material was fascinating and it was unlike most courses at Harvard.  The interdisciplinary approach was particularly great and something Harvard could use more of.
Get ready for a whirlwind; it's incredible, but you will take so many notes your hand hurts because you want to write everything down.
