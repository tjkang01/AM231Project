How is it that nearly 50% of all enslaved people from the trans-Atlantic slave trade were forced to go to Brazil, yet most history classes on slavery focuses on the US or other Latin American nations? This class allows students to begin to study slavery in the Brazilian context, one that has a rich, complicated history and opens the doors to further questions regarding Brazilian society and identity. Furthermore, this class studies slavery and how it interacted with notions of racial identity, medicine, and politics; this class refuses to study slavery as something that existed in a bubble without influencing any other aspect of society, and vice-versa. If one is a student that is interested in race, colonialism, Latin America, slavery, or the intersections between ideas of race and medicine, one MUST take this class.
The course is engaging and provides an introduction to Brazilian historiography and a variety of approaches to the topic.
This was a great class! Professor Chalhoub is a fantastic teacher and I really appreciated being able to take a course with him. Some of the class periods felt a bit disorganized, but I enjoyed them all.
Professor Chalhoub is one of those professors that has genuinely enriched my experience at Harvard. Whether you're interested in the topic or its historiography or not, take the course just for an excuse to get to know him.
