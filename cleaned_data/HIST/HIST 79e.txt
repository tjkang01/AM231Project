Professor Frank is truly terrific. Take this class!
Prof. Frank is a wonderful teacher with a vast set of knowledge, a probing intellect, and incisive humor at her disposal. The course intertwines several different disciplines and areas of study, from material culture to economic development.
A very worthwhile course, with an excellent professor.
An unusually fun class that provides a pretty good introduction to some important historical themes
The professor is great and the material is very interesting.
This is one of the best courses i've taken at Harvard.
If regular history classes are boring and rote, try this one.
