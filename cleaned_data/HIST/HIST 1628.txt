Sadly Professor Muscolino is a visiting lecturer, so I don't know when this course would ever be offered again. This was a fantastic course-one of the best I've taken at Harvard. If you are interested in learning modern Chinese history, which is really interesting, this course is a perfect candidate. Great discussions. Great books.
THIS IS AN AMAZING CLASS.
I am so sad that Prof. Muscolino is heading back to Georgetown. This has possibly been my favorite class throughout my time at Harvard. He was not only well-organized and committed, but also seemed to possess an exhaustive knowledge of Chinese history. Before entering this class, I had little to no knowledge about China's modern history, but now I feel as if I have a good grounding in the material. If Prof. Muscolino ever returns to Harvard, take this class!
