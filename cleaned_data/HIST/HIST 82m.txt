This was my favorite class at Harvard! Professor Lewis is an absolutely wonderful professor and she knows how to teach and structure the class properly. The course material she put together in the syllabus really worked well with each other. Also, Guillaume was a really helpful TF when it came to writing the research paper.
Take this class.  It is one of the best decisions I have made at Harvard and has tremendously impacted my academic trajectory, especially as I contemplate potential thesis topics.  One of my friends in the class switched from History and Literature to History, in large part thanks to this course.  Absolutely, absolutely do it.
Take this seminar! You'll have a blast and learn a lot!
This was a really awesome, unique opportunity to learn in a small-class setting. The readings were very interesting, and the assignments fair  the final project was good. I had a very nice time doing something I usually disliked with a passion (research).
