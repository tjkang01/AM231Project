Incredible class with readings that blew my mind every week. We need more Asian American Studies classes, Harvard!
This is the class that will change your perspective on life. Don't take it to try to discover identity. Take it to discover different ideas about the world.
Prepare for unhelpful discussions and convoluted readings, but you'll be exposed to lots of new and interesting ideas and perspectives.
If you have a class, since it is a seminar, that is more engaged, I think it would be really quite satisfying. But as it was this semester, it was a little like pulling teeth. The instructor is also less than enthusiastic, or feels less than enthusiastic, and I think that contributed to the general vibe of the course as well.
Please take this class. I learned so much and developed so much pride in my Asian American roots. I also met all the radical Asians, whom I'd been looking for for a long time at Harvard. Allan is amazing, and it's so sad that he's leaving. Hopefully they offer it in the future and hire more professors to teach this extremely important subject.
While the syllabus is challenging and intriguing, Lumba is a blas seminar leader.
