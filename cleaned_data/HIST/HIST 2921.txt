The course is a wonderful opportunity to discuss pedagogical issues and challenges associated with teaching a survey undergraduate course that covers major themes and events in global history - there are few if any other opportunities in the department to do this, and I therefore personally found the course extremely enriching not only from a professional development standpoint, but also for my own research.
The class reading material is spectacular.  Moreover, the process of engaging with history as a means to address the major questions of our times is both fascinating and enjoyable.
There will be a lot of reading, but if you can keep up with that and be prepared to report on your designated week, there is no "busywork."
