Professor Kishlansky is an expert in his field, and so if you are interested in Early Modern British History he is simply 'the' professor to work with. He expects hard work, and will challenge your ideas - but this is, in my experience, something that Harvard could do with much more of. His class made me reconsider my attitude and relationship to History, and I learnt a huge amount on the period. I would recommend his class.
