do the readings. this class only had 7 people in it so there's no faking/bsing if you don't do the readings. The professor is awesome and super engaging not only on an academic level but also just in a real way. He's not afraid to bring up injustices that are currently occurring and talk about them even if it's a tangent from the class discussion.
