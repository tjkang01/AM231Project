Great Class - covers a really interesting period of East Asian History. If you enjoy pre-modern history or are curious to learn more about Vietnam before French Occupation, I highly recommend.
Prof. Tai is very well-versed in her field. I find her lectures to be most interesting when she started to digress and talk about some weird aspects of history.
Great and easy course. Interesting material and well taught.
She is a fantastic professor who teaches with enthusiasm for the subject.  You will learn so much about a subject that you most likely do not know much about.
Excellent class to take as an elective if you're interested in history or for your concentration requirement. I took as an elective knowing nothing about Vietnam and learned an incredible amount about a very unique and interesting place. Piqued my interest to visit one day. Cool class I'd recommend as an elective for upperclassmen looking to take something they'll actually enjoy learning about.
Learn a lot about a history that isn't covered in traditional history classes.
Pay attention in class--very useful for the essays
This class was very relaxed and was a great choice as an elective.  The professor is awesome, really nice, and flexible about deadlines.
This is a straightforward and fascinating history course - structurally it was unlike any other experience I've had at Harvard, considering the attention Professor Hue gives to students and the materials available for instruction.
There aren't many students in the class but it is still in lecture format.
