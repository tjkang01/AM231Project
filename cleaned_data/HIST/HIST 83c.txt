A fantastic course for anyone interested in the question of how one ought to live, and not necessarily from an academic standpoint. The kind of course that is rarely found at Harvard these days, in that it forces you to engage in self-reflection.
Through the works of a fascinating range of Eastern and Western philosophers, this class helped me to see happiness, ethics and the world differently. However, it requires a lot of reading and at least some background in philosophy, and classes can be a little dry.
Definitely take this class! Professor Hankins is one of my favorite professors and Nate is an incredibly helpful TF. The topic material is not only interesting but will actually affect the way your view your life and your values (in a positive way!).
Take this class! It's a class that makes you think with a professor who makes you genuinely want to engage.
This was a great class! Professor Hankins a humorous and laid-back attitude for discussions and is well informed on the topic. He is clearly passionate about philosophy. This is not a traditional history course, but it teaches the information effectively.
These books are very important to read and will definitely offer a great perspective on life - some of them will even change your life! Hankins is adorable. Take this class to have good discussions. There is a very long end term paper though...
Take this class if you would really like to know about some of the core components of several popular historically significant philosophies.
This course is a good way to look at Renaissance intellectual history and its interaction with ancient philosophy, but it is not for the meek or the only casually interested.
I learned a lot about soul care philosophy but less about research methods.  I did learn a lot about argumentation from the supplementary section, worth attending by any student even if they're not looking for research credit.
