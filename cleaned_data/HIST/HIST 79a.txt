This class is a LOT of work, so it is not for the faint of heart.  However, I think it is very worthwhile.  It gives you a very complicated picture of the US in its interactions with the world, and provides you with a new and interesting set of facts and theories to apply to the US's history.  The books are varied in their analyses and approaches, and they are generally very engaging works.  The topics for essays are quite engaging; Professor Manela never once assigned the same topic for more than one unit.  One essay topic was a policy memo to the President; another compared the primary source usage of two books.  This class was a good investment of my time here at Harvard, and I do not regret the amount of work I put into the class.
Probably the hardest class I have taken at Harvard. Professor Manela requires so much of you in terms of the heavy reading load (250-400 pg book/wk) and the rigorous writing assignments (changed every week; were very interesting and format ranged from policy memo to President Obama to book review in an academic journal) but the work definitely teaches you flexibility and adaptability in your critical thinking skills and hones your reading and writing skills. Be prepared to sacrifice a lot of your time to this class but know that it is worth the set of transferable skills that you are gaining through the work. Only take if you are willing to put in time and effort.
