Learn to adopt modes of reading that make the material more, rather than less, digestible. Engage both the professor and the TF in meaningful waysshow up at office hours and ask questions.
This class provides an interesting perspective of the major global movements.  Don't take this course if you want an in depth, really detailed analysis.  It focuses on the broader movements with specific examples.
If a course shoots for the Sun, and you end up at the Moon, it was still worth taking. Don't be intimidated by the readings, you get used to them, and they are interesting enough to justify themselves for the most part.
This course was very interesting with a small class and great professor and TF, but the reading load each week is pretty intense.
This is a challenging course, but you will come out of it with a strong grasp on global trends in world history.
The lectures can be a bit confuddled, but if you are interested in the topic, then definitely take it.
This class is a challenge, but it comes with its rewards. Be prepared to do a LOT of reading and write essays on what you have read.
Professor Maier is incredible, and the course is really interesting. It's not too much work (mostly reading) but do go to class. You won't want to miss a lecture.
Be prepared to work hard, very self-directed, and learn more than in 3 other history courses put together. Put up with some disorganization and mediocre lectures for the sake of a rare opportunity for breadth and the chance to learn from a great historian.
I loved it, but make sure you know what you're getting into.
Professor Maier designed this class to be the most strenuous class any student should be taking in a given semester.  If you have other classes with large time commitments in terms of readings or if you have a lot of lengthy final papers I would consider putting it off for another semester.
If you love history, take this course
