This class was amazing! Professor More is awesome. Our readings were very interesting, and I'm not even usually into social history - I'm more into economic history. This was such a cool angle to explore history through, and I ended up learning a lot about current women's conditions in America. Discussions were super thought-provoking, two hours really flew by. The end of the semester paper was hard work, but so much fun to chew on!
Professor More is very very knowledgable about the topics discussed.  I would highly recommend taking any of her classes if you want to dig in deep on a topic and learn more about it.  It would be good to have some context/background on your own if not super familiar with U.S. history (or have forgotten from high school)
Take this course! Its a wonderful way to fulfill a seminar requirement in the history department. Professor More is truly a gem -- totally willing to help you in every step of the way.
This is a very interesting course. Professor More has chosen an excellent set of readings, and through the readings and engaging class discussions on them you will learn a lot about both the history of women and work in the United States and also the current situation. You are required to choose a research topic early in the semester, so come in with some idea of what you would like to do.
