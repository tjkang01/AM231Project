This course was extremely fascinating. As it was taught, it was both fascinating to see the new resources at Harvard's command to learn more about history and sometimes overwhelming. The research project also was both something that I greatly enjoyed, especially with the freedom of topic provided, and at first intimidating. I think that the best part of the course is that the professors and TF care greatly about the topics and are more than happy to help students explore the intersection of science and history.
this class was very interesting. the small format helped me gain a lot more from it. the professors are wonderful and dynamic, and super approachable. there isn't a lot demanded of you, but the final project can creep up on you. the poster was challenging because if you didn't have a previously on-going research project, you had to start from scratch, which is hard to do over the course of a few weeks. it was also hard to find a topic because i had very little background in these fields, so i spent most of the semester figuring out my interests, leaving little time to develop a strong research plan for the poster.the field trips are awesome, and i gained a lot from them!
Literally my favorite class I have ever taken at Harvard. Both the teachers are fantastic and the TF Elise was the same. Not that much work, everything you learn is interesting and you actually do cool stuff. I have absolutely nothing negative to say about this class.
