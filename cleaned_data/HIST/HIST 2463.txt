This is an important class. You will learn so much, work hard, and be inspired by Professor Higginbotham. If you have the availability and opportunity, definitely take this class.
This course is fantastic! And very difficult. Learning directly from Professor Higginbotham is a true privilege.
it was an intensive tour d'horizon through 20th-century african american history with a lot of reading, but also a lot of new insights. prof. higginbotham was great in drawing out the central themes and developments that characterized the 20th century and the small class facilitated in-depth discussions of the readings. i would take the class again any time!
Come to learn the little known tales of history!
Take any class with Prof. Higginbotham!
An excellent introduction to graduate-level readings in the 20th century African American U.S. History.
