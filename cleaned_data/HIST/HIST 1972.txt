This might be the best class I have taken at Harvard. Between the small size (4 grad students, 4 undergraduates), fascinating material, passionate nature of weekly discussions, balanced assignments that facilitated improvement in writing, and, most importantly, an organized, lively, dedicated professor, I feel like I am coming away with a more distinct appreciation for the complexities and difficulties of Americans acting as humanitarians in the world today.
The material covered in this class is fascinating. It's more an American foreign policy class than anything else, but looking at the history of American foreign policy through the lens of humanitarianism is so cool and something you won't get from any gov classes or probably any other history classes. A great overview of salient issues in humanitarianism, human rights, and international law in the last 150 years.
This class critically engages with the United States' humanitarian work overseas and considers the actors and historical context of the different projects. For anyone interested in foreign policy, international relations, or humanitarianism, this class is definitely for you. It is also a course in which you will develop your writing with clarity and purpose as you consider primary and secondary sources.
This was a great class! Dr. Black is a fantastic teacher.
This was one of the most fun and engaging classes that I've ever taken at Harvard. Black is a great teacher and facilitator, and the class is structured to engage students with a variety of interests around the idea of American humanitarianism. The class does a remarkable job covering colonial America to the present and artfully combines primary and secondary sources.
I recommend with enthusiasm any course taught by Professor Megan Black, her courses are both satisfyingly challenging and thoroughly enjoyable.
