Professor Gordon referred to this class as "dessert" for him. That is perhaps the only fitting description of the class; it was both enormously stimulating and enjoyable.
This class is incredible. Peter Gordon is fantastic, knows his stuff incredibly well, and leads discussion effortlessly. He's also funny! The reading is totally fascinating, though it's also very dense (warning: if you're not interested in Habermas or have never heard of him, you might want to think twice about taking this course). The people in this class were also quite insightful.
Peter Gordon is amazing, do not leave Harvard without taking a class with him.. The class is amazing and the material and discussions are not to be missed
I Highly recommend this course, if you are at all interested in the Frankfurt school, the challenges of modernity in relationship to religion, and the thought of Habermas in particular.
Gordon is one of the best teachers--if not THE best--I have encountered at Harvard. Do the reading, show up to class, participate in the discussion, and your mind will be well-rewarded.
This class would have been great if it were smaller. As it was, however, the discussions were poor due to the class size.
If you're already interested in the Frankfurt School, this class is a great way to understand some of the underlying motivations of its thinkers.
