I had a really good experience in the class, maybe because of the particular class dynamic; I don't know if it'll be offered again in future years but I hope that there are more classes like this at Harvard that really engage with the material in an intimate setting. I learned so much about different historical approaches and found areas of study that I didn't even know existed before. Tracy is great and overall it was a wonderful class.
Tracy was amazing - such a wonderful experience to take a course with a visiting professor.  It was a treat to take such a small seminar style class.  I feel like I really came away with a deeper appreciation for history as a discipline.  I feel much more well rounded!  And I liked the way this course helped me think about the past as a social construction (it makes sense now)!
