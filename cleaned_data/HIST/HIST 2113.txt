Although this is a graduate seminar, I really enjoyed it as an undergraduate, and I'd strongly recommend it to anyone regardless of their year in college/grad school.
This class is a great introduction to the oeuvre of Dante. I don't think that I would suggest it as a first course to take on Dante, but for those who are already familiar with the Commedia, this is a great class to expand your knowledge about one of the greatest works and greatest authors of western literature.
