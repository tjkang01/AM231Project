You should definitely take this course! The professors are incredibly knowledgeable and the readings are very useful. It encourages your to think in new ways and try to eliminate biases. The discussions in class were deeply nuanced and made me want to be prepared for every class.
Great course on a really interesting and important subject. Lots of reading but worth doing. Great opportunity to learn from two incredible professors in a small group setting.
This class is one of the best I've taken. The content is really interesting and the professors are incredibly knowledgeable. Be ready for 2 hours of discussion every week, though - it is a class requirement to speak at least once, so come decently prepared.
It was a great class. If you are interested in mental health or in sub-Saharan Africa, you will not be disappointed.
This class is excellent! It's a must-take. The professors are really knowledgeable and helpful. The information makes you think critically.
Fascinating material, incredible professors. The class is a very straightforward seminar but you'll learn a lot and consider some intriguing and intellectually stimulating material.
The topic is incredibly interesting; however, the class was not as enlightening as I expected it to be. The professors did not give much guidance for the final paper and assigned papers without much notice. I feel as though I still have a very tenuous understanding of what it means to be mentally ill in Africa.
Arguably my favorite course I have taken thus far at Harvard.  Both professors are phenomenal and seem to take the course seriously despite being renowned professors.  The materials are also among the most interesting I have read for any class.
