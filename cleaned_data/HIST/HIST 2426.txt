If you are a gender historian this is an essential seminar to take with one of the best gender historians in the U.S.
This is a challenging course, and requires quite a bit of your time and effort, but it is incredibly worth it!
I would strongly discourage students from taking this class if they do not already have a paper idea in mind because there is not enough time to think of an idea and then execute it fully. Anyone who does have a paper idea should absolutely take this course because it will help them develop an excellent paper and give them a good framework for future projects as well.
This course is excellent. It provides a chance to workshop your essay ideas, to develop presentation skills and to thoroughly think through an article-length project.
I would highly recommend not only picking a topic but doing a fair amount of secondary reading before the course begins. The research component of the course gets going very quickly, and it's difficult to be reading long secondary works while trying to come up with a research design and an argument.
