Don't be afraid to think out of the box with the projects! Prof. Brown and Ben are there to support you and really want to see what you mind can produce! Additionally, the reading can sometimes be a lot (usually) but it is so worth it and the more you do, the more awesome the course will be.
This is a great course which will provide you with invaluable digital humanities skills along with the expected knowledge about the subject matter.
The class is great, but the assignments are hard and time-consuming. I definitely think it's worth it, but I would definitely only take it during a semester when you really have the time
Stay on top of readings! Great class, but readings and projects can sneak up on you if you don't plan accordingly.
