I'd say, "Look, the man is a great scholar, writes cogently, great books and articles, but he just seriously cannot conduct a course." And I've told that to people already.
Professor Sarna is at the absolute head of his field. If he has not written the sources you're reading, he has edited them or knows the person who wrote them or in some other way is linked to these academics. Really worth it if you've already thought about these problems, but may seem esoteric/inaccessible if you haven't.
Only take this class if you are interested in being in the presence of Sarna's expertise. In terms of discussion or personal development, this class will not help.
You get what you put in. If you really think about the issues Sarna is raising, then it is an engaging class.
A great way to have an introduction into American and Jewish history.
