Readings are great, professor is very knowledgeable and nice, so seminar meetings are wonderful -- although that's also dependent on what kind of people take it. The paper assignments are short and you don't have to work far in advance, but always have them in the back of your mind while doing the readings. You get a relative amount of freedom with topics too.
Prof O'Neill is not only a preeminent scholar of the Russian Empire, but an imaginative and interesting teacher as well. I highly recommend this class, even if its topic or workload seem a bit intimidating - it was definitely worth it!
Amazing class and professor; great discussion environment (but remember to do all the reading so that you can participate usefully)
A close look at one of the most fascinating and mistakenly-maligned monarchs with a truly enthusiastic and knowledgeable professor.
Be ready to read a lot and discuss the readings in depth.
It's a great class if you want to learn a little bit too much about Catherine the Great. After this class you'll probably going to know more than you will ever need to know about Catherine the Great.
It's an extremely well-designed and enjoyable class that also is a very good guide as to how to approach history in general
Definitely take this class whether you need it for a requirement or not.
You need to be interested in Catherine and the history of Russia under her rule to really appreciate everything you learn in this course.
