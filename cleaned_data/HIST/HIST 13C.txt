This class will challenge you to think critically about the development of the American city, particularly with regard to race and class.
Take this class. It will make you reevaluate the way you understand white supremacy, capitalism, western expansion, and the way you've been taught American history. Also Prof. Johnson makes it super easy to talk in class -- you don't have to be a genius, you just have to be interested in the material.
The course is exceedingly interesting, but Prof. Johnson has very strong opinions on the topic which can be intimidating.
I entered every class excited to discuss St. Louis with my fellow classmates, the TF, and Professor Johnson. The readings are incredibly thought-provoking, as are classes. The discussions in all honesty can get extreme, especially as we are talking about touchy issues of race and poverty. However, if you can maintain your composure and focus on learning, then you will get a lot out of this course.
Over all an excellent class. Readings were generally very enjoyable and informative, as well as not overwhelming in terms of time commitment. Discussion led by Professor Johnson is as instructive as it is entertaining, as Professor Johnson (on top of being very knowledgeable on his subject) also has an excellent sense of humor. Ultimately this was a class I actively looked forward to every week.
