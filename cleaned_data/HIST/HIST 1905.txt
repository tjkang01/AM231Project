Professor Hall is fantastic and promotes discussion and questions
Well this course is great but the issue is you don't know what your grade is until the very end. Its nice that you don't have any assignments along the way apart from weekly readings and contributing to class discussion but then your entire grade is basically based on your final paper. I haven't looked at my grade yet so its really 50/50 right now. Dr. Hall does not give much feedback beforehand but is super nice and also super chill for a Harvard Professor, but again be warned because I'm feeling like he might be a hard grader.
