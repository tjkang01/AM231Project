A very good course about a very important decade.  There is a lot of freedom in choosing a research paper topic too which is important, and at least our year not a lot of people took it so you basically have to do the reading and because of this you get a lot out of the discussions in class.
I felt that I learned a lot about the New Deal in terms of labor reform, but not in other areas.  The research is a lot of individual work but rewarding if you choose a good topic.
This course requires a good deal of commitment to work outside of the readings.
This course ranged from moderate to difficult, mostly because there was 1) an enormous amount of reading to complete and 2) the expectation that in addition to the reading we would be doing research every week. Professor McGirr is brilliant, but sometimes research guidance was lacking. Sitting down with her was ALWAYS helpful, but the trick is catching her when she has free time.
It's fun to research a topic that you pick.  However, be prepared to read a lot and have to be able to speak about your reading easily and quickly.  It's hard to get both the reading and the research done.
You learn a ton both about the subject but also how to conduct original research.
You won't have your hand held, and you'll be asked to do tons of reading an even more writing. And since it's normally a very small seminar, there is no getting away with not doing the readings. Never the less, it's a fantastic intellectual experience and will really improve how you understand the New Deal and the discipline of history.
