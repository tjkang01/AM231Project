It was a fantastic introduction to digital history, which I was able to fit into my schedule according to my needs. The combination of flexibility and utility--as well as the great expertise of the instructor--were exactly what I needed in getting my feet wet in digital history. I would just tell students that it is definitely an introduction rather than a very in-depth tutorial in any one method or tool (i.e. don't take this as a "GIS class" or as a "network analysis class").
