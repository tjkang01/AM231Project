One of the best classes I've taken - Professor Brown is inspiring and I learned something fascinating after each class meeting. There aren't many ways to get truly creative at Harvard, but this is the best ways to do it. Take it!
This is a great supplement for students who are already working on projects that they want to present in an alternative medium.
Only take the class if you're already working on a project.  There is not enough time to start something new--that is, if you want to do something meaningful and worthwhile and not just go through the motions.
This has been one of the most rewarding academic experiences of my life.  Professor Brown is brilliant, the collaborative studio style was highly rewarding, and the guest speakers and reading material were inspiring.  Thank you, Professor Brown, for an incredible experience.  If you have the good fortune to have found this course, as you are reading this q-guide, TAKE IT!
this is a great course where you can learn from leading scholars in the field of history design, and take on the challenge to develop your own multimedia project. readings, presentations, discussions are well balanced.
