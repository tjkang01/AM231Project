A critical exploration of "Asian history." Awesome course. Take it.
In this age of the global eminence and economic rise of the Asian countries like China, India and Japan - Prof. Bose's course is invaluable in understanding the history of that trajectory and also to gain perspective on the problems of the present.
Readings are hard to decipher, discussions are interesting but unfocused.
This class is completely unorganized, incredibly dull, and I came out of it feeling like I largely learned nothing. Its taught like a graduate school course where everyone is an expert in the field. Only take it if you're very interested in complex Southeast Asian economic history, because that's basically all this class focuses on.
This may be very satisfying to you if you have a solid knowledge of Indian postcolonial theory and history, but otherwise, you probably won't get a lot out of it. Our classes frequently became a discussion among the graduate students and Professor Bose, with the rest of us unable to participate.
