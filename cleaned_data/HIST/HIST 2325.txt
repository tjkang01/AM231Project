I would recommend a course with this professor to anyone -- just not in this particular format. The professor made a huge effort to offer us a wealth of excellent readings and resources (five guests for seminar, public lecture, and dinner), but it simply did not allow time to engage deeply with much of the readings or to build a basis for class conversation. Consider a course with Prof. Gordon that has a more focused syllabus and think carefully about the balance of reading load against your others courses.
This is what I imagined Harvard would be like before coming here. The other students were incredible and I learned a lot from Prof. Gordon. Take this class if remotely interested in Hannah Arendt/Political thought of 20th cent./Jewish thinking/History of Zionism. It touches upon all that and much more. Be ready to read a lot, form opinions and be challenged.
