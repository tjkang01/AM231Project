Take Ghosh if he offers the seminar.
The seminar discussions were usually more focused on historiography and honing skills a future historian would need in their research. They were usually less about the content of the book itself.
The professor makes the class. Ghosh is smart, friendly, and a great guide. Be aware that this course is as much about the historiography as the history of China.
