Good class, lots of reading.
IF YOU LIKE SOCIAL HISTORY, TAKE THIS CLASS. Dean Lassonde is such a well-informed American historian, and discussions are effectively guided. If you have any interest in American history, and in thinking about history through the lens of often underrepresented voices (children), this course offers a great taste of both--and does so in an interesting way. The course is very thematic and works with periodization of history, as you read what many different historians have to say about children throughout history.
