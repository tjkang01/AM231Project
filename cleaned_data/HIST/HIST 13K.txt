This course was highly theoretical. A lot of the reasons were dense and abstract, so if you don't adequately prepare (as in read the readings thoroughly) you will be lost.
Very specific course, it's important to really enjoy music and especially Beethoven.
This course is a great fusion between music and history. As a someone who concentrated in something non-music, I sometimes felt very behind, but in the end this class was a great experience, and I can say that I honestly enjoyed it.
