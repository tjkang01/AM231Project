This class will improve your knowledge of Latin paleography. In the end of this class you will be able to read with ease difficult Humanistic texts. It is also a very good introductory class of textual criticism. We had the chance to edit a text by B.Platina and all the other assignments were very useful. I recommend it with enthusiasm
Indispensable class. Prof. Hankins has an incredibly rich knowledge of manuscripts and the class is a great introduction to the tools and techniques central to this kind of work.
