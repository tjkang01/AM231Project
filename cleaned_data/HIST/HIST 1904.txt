I would tell future students that the reading material skews toward the 17th/18th centuries, so those who are interested in learning primarily about polygamy from early Mormonism through present might be disappointed. On a positive note, I would let them know that the workload is manageable and the assignments are thoughtfully designed and leave a lot of room for student interest.
One of the oddest, and most interesting courses I will ever take. The material in this class -- especially the American and Mormon material -- is unbelievably interesting. Ulrich is the most gifted archival historian you'll ever see, probably, and she can give great insights into primary texts. Also a great foray into legal history.
One of my favorite classes! Be prepared to read a lot each week (all of the readings are great so it's not that hard!)
It is an incredibly interesting topic and Professor Ulrich's investment in the topic makes the readings and class conversations particularly dynamic and engaging. Would absolutely recommend.
Dr. Ulrich is an expert in this subject and speaking with her about her book was a rich and rare experience.  But even more valuable was learn throughout the course her skill and tools as a historian.  I've learned historical methodologies that will be useful for all my future research!
