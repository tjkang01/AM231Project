Professora Deloria is amazing! Take this class if you get the chance!
Quality quality class, and Professor Deloria really cares about the subject and truly supports students with all levels of familiarity with the material. Highly recommended.
Phil is one of the kindest, most excellent professors or ever had - take a class with him! Also, it's crucial that everyone take a Native American studies course in order to understand US history. Take this class!!
This course is unlike any other at Harvard. It is a shame that Harvard does not give more attention to Native American studies, which makes this course a must for anyone curious. Not to mention, you get to spend two hours every week with one of the top researchers in this field. The readings can be a little dense, but they are well worth it. You can either write a 25 page research final paper, or five five-page papers (every other week) throughout the semester. The latter is not too difficult; if you have an interest in the materials in class, then it should be a breeze. In general, the professor is pretty chill, and class is just a really good time every week.
