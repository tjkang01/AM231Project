This course will make you a scholar. It gives back what it takes. The readings are heavy but they are worth it.
The the class is demanding but rewarding.
When you are done with this course you will be able to do independent archival research!
This is an excellent class, with an interesting selection of topics and a great selection of readings. Professor Akyeampong's knowledge of the subject is impressive, and his ability to share both this and his enthusiasm makes for a very rewarding semester. The reading load is not light, however, so be prepared to work hard.
I would recommend this course to students who are interested in gaining a truly in-depth understanding of early African history.  I might recommend that they take an introductory African history course before taking this course.
Refreshingly practical in its attention to research methods, sources, and pedagogy. A class that will not only teach you the major focal points and thematic debates in early African history but teach you to teach them!
This is an intensive course which will reward you "intensive". For those who want to study Africa, please do not miss this course.
