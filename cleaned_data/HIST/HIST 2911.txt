Semi-comprehensive and detailed history of international law, from Grotius to contemporary theorists.
This is a great course for students interested in international history, particularly the more theoretical aspects of the field. It is helpful to have some background in the major primary texts of early modern political/legal thought, since the course covers only secondary works which are often interpretations of 17th/18th c texts. However, the focus on very recent historiography helps students understand which questions are currently being debated by scholars and which topics remain open for further research.
Armitage is on the forefront of the emerging field of "International Legal and Political Thought" and this is an outstanding course for anyone interested in "a radically historicist" reading of international law, international relations, and anyone interested in grappling with many of the largest problems facing the world in the past and today.
This course requires a good deal of work and will be very informative. Prof. Armitage is truly an expert in the field and a very skilled discussion leader.
