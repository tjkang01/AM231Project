This course will be beneficial for you for developing knowledge about the history of Istanbul
This was an extremely interesting course, both in form and content - as a history student, I appreciated being able to discuss unfamiliar concepts like urbanism and architecture with students in those fields. Professors Kafadar and Bozdoan are both experts whose knowledge cannot be understated. The course material is informative and a little theory-heavy, but not at all a chore to read.
