This course provides a challenging but fruitful opportunity for students to critically and constructively reflect upon their general approaches to scholarly and pedagogical practice, all while gaining a useful introduction to the study of empires throughout history.
A great introduction to a number of important topics in imperial and global history.
Coming from a specialization outside of western Europe, I felt that this class gave me a good framework and foundation for understanding debates about imperial history going on in that particular area. I really found the assignments worthwhile and for that alone I think the course is worth taking.
It provokes extremely lively and engaging discussion in class, it provides concrete experience and instruction in pedagogy, and it offers a broad-reaching synthesis of world history from numerous competing perspectives. The readings are great.
I think this course helps teach you both about comparative empires but also starts you thinking about how to teach, how to write a syllabus, etc.
This class has a lot of potential. Professors Lewis and Jasanoff are really excellent professors--and are experts on empire--so it was a treat to have them in the same room.
