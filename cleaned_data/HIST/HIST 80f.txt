This class is a really fun way to build up research skills, as well as public speaking/presentation skills, which aren't emphasized much in most Harvard humanities classes. The workload is a little intense, in terms of the amount of material you have to become familiar with, but is very manageable in terms of number/type of graded assignments.
This was my favorite course I've taken at Harvard thus far.  The professor is wonderfully enthusiastic, and the workload definitely prepares you for writing a senior thesis.  It's demanding, but it is so worth it.  Just be warned, this course takes over your life.  Also, it really helps to know French, German, or Latin.
I took this course because everyone in McCormick's research seminar last spring absolutely raved about it on the Q. I thought this one was less than fantastic.
It's difficult work and far from the most interesting material, but you simply cannot graduate from Harvard with a history degree without taking a McCormick course. Take this one if you're at all passionate about medieval Europe.
If you have already taken a medieval history class and are interested in pushing yourself incredibly hard on a single topic, or are interested in producing publishable work, this is the class for you.
I highly recommend this course on the merits of the learning experience with Professor McCormick, but caution that only experienced history students take on the work load.
This is what a research seminar should be - a professor who truly believes that his students can come up with new, independent research, and who will do anything to make it happen.
