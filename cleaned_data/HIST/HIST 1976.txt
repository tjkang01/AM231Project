This is a great class! Professor Koll is a wonderful person who cares so much about the material and facilitating discussion amongst the class.  If you are an undergrad, I would make sure that you have a good deal of knowledge about China's political and social history.  A bit of business and economic history is helpful too, but you learn loads.
