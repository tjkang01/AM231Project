A truly unique experience to work one-on-one with a professor, and one that I will cherish. Professor Mckenzie gives excellent, thoughtful feedback on assignments, and is invested in helping students produce their best work. She is very knowledgeable of the material, but also very approachable and apt at facilitating discussion. Highly recommend this course, and the professor!
