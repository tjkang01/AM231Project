Definitely take this course if you're interested in it, but be prepared to be seriously challenged, both by the level of conversation and the volume of reading. You'll come out with a really useful grounding in important historiography for American intellectual history and an appreciation of how academics evaluate work in their field. I would recommend only taking it if you already have a background in intellectual history methods and historiography.
This is an excellent survey of important primary and secondary texts in American intellectual history. Class discussion is lively, but expect it to revolve around a set of pre-distributed "tell me what I'm thinking"-type questions, which makes for a pretty dull reading experience. Discussion also tends to get sidetracked easily, and a large portion of the assigned material usually wasn't touched upon.
