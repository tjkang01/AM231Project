This is a great class if you are prepared to learn genetic techniques in science and biochemical pathways involved in human disease. This is a great class if you are prepared to spend many hours a week (during the biochemistry portion) memorizing these pathways. While memorization sounds terrible, it really primes you for high-level thinking when tackling problems about human disease.
