This is an interesting and painless class with lots of opportunities to interact with SCRB professors.  It was a great survey course of the stem cell research being done at Harvard.
I thought it was a great opportunity to get exposed to what Harvard stem cell people are up to in a low-key setting.
This is a great way to learn a lot about current research in the field.
Take it if you want to learn more about stem cell biology in a relaxed atmosphere.
I very much liked SCRB200. I really liked the guest speakers Dr. Rubin lined up, and I felt that he had chosen professors from a variety of areas that were specifically interested in teaching undergraduates (for the most part). I appreciated having the opportunity to meet a lot of the professors and taking the class alongside graduate students - it made the discussion reach a much higher level than in any of my science classes thus far, something I really benefitted from. Take this class!
This class is nice because you will get to meet the many amazing scientists from around Harvard and you'll know what they are going to publish in Nature after 2 weeks!
super easy- just start the final paper early
