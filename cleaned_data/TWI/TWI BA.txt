This class is awesome. Cindy really tries to help you with everything. Minimal stress just having fun learning more Twi and how to read well. Theater night was really cool as well. The exams are pretty easy just review. Take it, especially if you wanna brush up on your twi!
I have taken and will continue to take this class EVERY SEMESTER, EVERY YEAR of my Harvard undergraduate career...it is simply AMAZING :)
This is a great course! It's very helpful and will improve one's reading/writing and speaking ability in Twi!
Take Twi! Professor is a precious Ghanaian man and he really does enjoy having students in his class. You don't need to have spoken Twi before or even know the language, but generally be curious and interested in Ghanaian culture.
great fifth class and is not that much work.
Charles is literally the greatest teacher ever!
really have to push to learn more than simple grammatical words
Take the class! It's a very chill course but you do learn a lot of vocabulary.
