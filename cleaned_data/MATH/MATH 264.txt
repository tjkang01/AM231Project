Tristan's PDE class offered a nice introduction to PDEs, which is a subject not normally taught at Harvard. Tristan's lectures gave really good intuition about techniques of proof and also why you would care about results, which is very difficult to get from most textbooks on the subject.
Well if Tristan teaches another class consider taking it -- not sure really who would read this since it's a topics clas.
