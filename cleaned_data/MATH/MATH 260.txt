A wonderful class: the pacing was just right and the material is very interesting.
Amazing class! The mapping class group is an extraordinary structure; its properties are exceptionally fascinating. I do indeed recommend this class, even if it at times was a little difficult. A pretty rigorous low-dimensional topology class.
