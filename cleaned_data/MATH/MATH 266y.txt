Not all great professor are great teachers, but in Joe Harris' algebraic geometry class you have the opportunity to drink in the master's insight, and learn intuition that can't be found in books. He presents many great results in the theory of parameter spaces, deformation theory, and moduli in a down-to-earth, comprehensible way (by contrast, the literature is, to me at least, fairly impenetrable). There's an emphasis on intuition and examples, as opposed to rigor and foundational material. I found the homework quite difficult because the necessary tools often aren't introduced in class. This is an advanced course, and you're expected to have a lot of algebraic geometry knowledge at your fingertips: in particular, more than is covered in Hartshorne II and III.
A great course if you're interested in families of curves, or just want better geometric intuition.
