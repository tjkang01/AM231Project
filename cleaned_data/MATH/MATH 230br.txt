The course turned out to be more of a topics course than I had realized -- I did not have the prerequisites and struggled to follow the lectures.
Lectures hard to follow.
The class provides ideas, while extensive reading outside of class is really important in getting to learn things.
The course topics change from year to year. Nothing I put down here will be very helpful.
