SUPER HARD but really cool!
Definitely take this, even though it'll never be offered again.
Any class Eric is teaching, take it - he has a keen sense of what's interesting.
Eric is a great instructor and the course has great material. You won't be able to get this experience at any other school.
This class was super interesting, and I'll probably be writing my senior thesis on the first chapter of Eric's book covered in this class.
