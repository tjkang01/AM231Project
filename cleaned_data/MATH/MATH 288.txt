It's a great course. Many great (and in-depth) materials and you would definitely learn a lot about (rigorous) stochastic analysis. Workload is OK.
It's a topics course so it's hard to tell when it will be offered again. I liked HT's lecture style though, so I would definitely recommend taking a class with him.
Professor Yau is a great lecturer - engaging and entertaining. This class didn't require a crazy amount of work, but the material was difficult - do come prepared.
