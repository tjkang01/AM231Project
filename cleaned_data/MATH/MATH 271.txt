I'm not sure when it'll be offered next, but the few people that know the material well enough should be amazing teachers. Arul obviously knows this stuff inside out, so it was a wonderful time taking the course from him. Of course, it's a hard course, and the ideas may seem alien at first, but just take time to digest and process the information and it's amazing.
