The material is very important.
What I say here is irrelevant, because the course changes completely with a different teacher and subject, and those change every year. But 212br this year was great because of the low student-to-faculty ratio and because it was not that difficult.
Sternberg is an excellent lecturer.  His course will be interesting and off the beaten road.  He clearly puts a lot of effort into his teaching.
1. Read the lecture slides before lecture!2. You'd better be familiar with quantum mechanics.
Real analysis is not my interest and this course goes into a lot of detail which you will not need unless you are going to be an analyst.
