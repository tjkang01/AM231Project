You will learn a lot of set theory. It's tough, but really cool.
For anyone who is interested in the subject matter, I recommend this class without reservation or hesitation. The class is very small (it was this year, anyways) and lectures feel a lot more like a conversation with the professor Koellner. Problem sets are reasonable, and the subject matter is really interesting and well-explained. Often I leave a math class feeling like I have a surface understanding of the material, enough to do the homework but not a particularly deep understanding. Math 145a did not feel this way at all. Overall a great class.

Also, forcing is insanely cool.
