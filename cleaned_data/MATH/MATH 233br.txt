Algebraic geometry is awesome.
If you want to learn schemes, this course is the way to go. Too bad Dennis won't probably be teaching it for a while.
whenever you can, take Dennis's classes
really really abstract, i feel like i will appreciate it a lot more when i see more applications of the theory
We were lucky this year to have a great schemes class. Future students should be careful if the person teaching the class is different. (That's not to say that those classes won't be great, too, of course!)
It gets better - the second semester of schemes begins to tie together the countless odd definitions we learned in the first semester.
