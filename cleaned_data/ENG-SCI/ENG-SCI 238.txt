Eh. Less cool than you might think.
It's nice to get a business perspective as a grad student working on developing new technologies.
This class is an incredible, practical, exposure to innovation and entrepreneurship at HBS and the iLab!!! Great class, HIGHLY recommend it if you can get into the class!  The first 1/2 is full of exciting case studies, then you take an HBS case study "final", and then the last 1/2 is working on a project - a new venture or developing a business idea!  Really fantastic class and great exposure to the world of venture capital, cash flow models, etc.  Take it if you are an entrepreneur, like investing etc.
As someone who is working at a startup and is very interested in venture capital, I really loved this class. The case studies and case method were a lot of fun and informative. We learned important qualitative and technical concepts. It would have been nice to have a section component to dive into the technical concepts more though.
This class is very interesting and presents real life examples of innovative people and their ventures. It equips you with the tools necessary to start your own business.
If you want to learn how to address large-scale problems in a way that people can relate to, take this class!  The professors are great, and they require you to think about the world outside of just the numbers.
A great class for all those interested in Entrepreneurship. Though I wasn't a huge fan of the online participation portion, the class kept me engaged for the most part. The material is quite interesting and both professors are accomplished, experienced entrepreneurs with a lot of wisdom to offer.
