I would take any course Zhigang taught.
This course is truly hidden jewel at Harvard. Spending hours to commute back and forth from MIT is worth in every single minute! Great source of knowledge and inspiration for people both in mechanics and other disciplines.
best fracture mechanics class in Cambridge!
This course was probably the most fascinating, practical, and overall enjoyable course I've taken in SEAS. Professor Suo was always very enthusiastic, excited to teach, happy to answer questions, and gave the course a very keen focus with smart progression. Suo's notes were fantastic, and the lectures hit on very interesting and useful aspects of fracture mechanics and its applications. Lectures were conducted in a kind of seminar format - there were no pre-readings, but students contributed to every lecture, whether by asking questions or answering them, and that made the experience all the better. Overall, I'm very happy that I took the course, and I recommend it to anyone who's looking to take a grad course in SEAS.
Before you take this class be aware: You will not be exposed into the details of fracture mechanics. You will barely see analytical solutions and you will rarely be asked to solve real problems. You will be introduced to the concepts and you will be asked to read a lot of published papers. You should know all that before you take this course. If you are looking for a course on the Mechanis of Fracture this is not what you are looking for. If you are interested in the concepts and ideas behind Fracture, then you should take this course.
One of the best classes I've ever taken, let alone at Harvard
Do the homeworks studiously, read all the class material offered.
