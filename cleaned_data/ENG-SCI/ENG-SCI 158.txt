This was only the first year of the course, it has a lot of potential but needs to improve a lot of the logistics of what to teach, how to teach it and how to test the students' knowledge of it.
Very difficult, very interesting material. Taught extremely well. Some engineering background would help, but Lina is extremely supportive of all backgrounds.
This is a really fun course. It was a little shaky being a first year course, but that is to be expected. Lina is a great professor and the TFs were extremely helpful.
This course brings together (or motivates, depending on when you take it) a lot of concepts you will learn in the engineering sciences curriculum. For that reason, it has been one of the most valuable courses I have taken at Harvard. I highly recommend it.
I think everyone has the potential to be successful in this class, especially if you put in the time and reach out to the staff and use the textbook as a resource.
Very applicable but very hard to understand to the depth that you need to be good at it. Lina is a very good professor and cares a lot about the students.
The material in the course can be difficult, but the teaching staff is very willing to help teach you anything that you are struggling with.
This class is good, but you will have to spend some time learning the material outside of class.
I really enjoyed this class and would definitely recommend it if you enjoyed ES156 at all. Lina is a great teacher who really cares about her students, and you will learn a lot of interesting stuff in this class.
If you are interested in controls at all, this is a great class to take.All the assignments and exams are fair.
