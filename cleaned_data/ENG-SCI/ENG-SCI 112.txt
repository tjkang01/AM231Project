If you are looking to really understand thermodynamics and be able to relate it immediately to devices around you, this class is for you
This course is a new and fascinating way to look at thermodynamics. It's the sort of course you come to Harvard for: engage with the subject matter and interact directly with a Harvard professor.
This class is a great way to master (or attempt to master) complicated thermo topics in a relaxed and engaging environment. The case study approach is a blast and much more relevant than I would imagine the other thermo class to be
Keep thinking about the field of study you are interested, and how thermodynamics can be understood in that field. That would be very interesting!
