Do not take this course unless you are fully comfortable dedicating a very large number of hours (on average at least 15 hours) per week.  (I did not know that the workload was going to be quite as bad as it was until after the drop deadline.)
Anyone with an interest in RF design must take this course.
Gear up for LOT's of work!
If you are enthusiastic about electronics and communication systems, this is an excellent class and the instructor (Prof. Ham) portrays the enthusiasm.
Student can learn so much about radio frequency circuits and will gain hand-on skills.
It will be very helpful to have circuit and semiconductor devices background before taking this course.
You can learn difficult things by grasping relatively simple essence here with the help of a talented, enthusiastic and relaxing professor.
Be prepared to have a real hands-on experience in circuit design.
I would tell students to take this class if they have a strong electronics background.  For students who have not conentrated in electronics, I would cautions them and tell them they will have to work hard if they really want to take the class.
The lectures are entertaining, and this course will help you as an experimentalist even if you don't think any of your work is related to RF Electronics.
