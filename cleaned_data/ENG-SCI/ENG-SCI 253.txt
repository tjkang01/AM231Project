The class is very doable and you get as much out of it that you put into it. Try to present on a topic you find interesting and is related to your final project. The class makes you think and understand some fairly complex topics.
If you are working in any field that involves the study of bio-potentials and you do not already understand the basic principles behind them (their origin and how they are recorded), this class is a must.
