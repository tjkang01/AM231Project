This course is just an AI class with all the fun sucked out of it.
This course is definitely useful for engineers who need to perform statistical analyses. The workload is more than I should be, I believe.
Decision theory is a fundamental course for anyone doing algorithm development.
Difficult and frustrating while taking the course but definately educational. Material is useful and the class teaches it well.
Be ready to put in decent work and you will learn a lot.
ES 201 covers a wide range of interesting material. However, if you have already taken Stat 210, Stat 210, or even Stat 171, there may be too much overlap. ES 201 surveys a wide range of methods without going into too much depth, which may be appropriate for some people and not for others.
The course is good to take, but the professor is hard to follow.
Take it but make sure it has the MATLAB component to it.
Nice exposure to a wide variety of topics in decision theory. Donatello is an awesome professor!
