You will actually understand everything that goes on in the clouds above you
ES132 was a very interesting introduction to meteorology. Professor Farrell is super passionate about the atmosphere / weather, which is really nice. I learned a lot overall, although I do wish that some simpler things would have been explained in the class. Maybe it was assumed we all know the basic things like what cyclones are, etc., but if you don't, watching basic youtube videos is helpful. :) Otherwise I thought that the class was a good level of difficulty and interesting.
Gets very math heavy towards the end but is a good overview of weather systems and atmospheric motions and trends. If you are into this I would recommend it.
