A lot of homework
Be prepared to spend plenty of time on this, whether  it be on the project or on the assignments.  You learn a lot about ABAQUS but it unfortunately takes up a lot of time (sometimes it's just on learning about the many problems with FORTRAN77).
If you are not going to use abaqus a lot, audit it.The homework may be too heavy a load for you.
This class takes lots of your time, but spending that time is worth, really helpful for your research.
Most helpful class for my research I've taken in grad school.
This class will teach you a lot of advanced skills for ABAQUS. It's very helpful. The instructor is nice.
make sure you are comfortable with applied math methods
Take this course for a good overview of the behavior and analysis of beams, plates and shells.  The final project at the end really brings everything that is learned together.
It is good to take the class for credit.  I am not sure you can learn too much just from auditing it unless you are diligent enough to work through all of the homework anyway.
