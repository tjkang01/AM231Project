Take advantage of the exciting opportunity to operate a robot arm.
The course is pretty comprehensive but taught in a digestible manner.
The class was interesting, but focused entirely on robot arms instead of mobile robots. Very challenging amount of linear algebra and geometry.
Learned a lot, but it's a busy class. Lab and HW alternate weeks.
30 hours/week outside of class is not uncommon, so be prepared.
It's good, close to the course description, well taught.
The lectures were a little dry, but what the class teaches is important and helpful if you're studying robotics. The labs were really helpful to apply course information to an actual robot.
The course with Professor Wood is quite interesting, but a lot of the algebra gets very tedious and this can be a major downside to some of the homeworks as well as making for occasional tedious lectures. The first several labs are rather uninteresting and unmotivational, but the last two are quite interesting and involve solving real problems with a real robot.
It's a really useful course. If you try to know something about the robotics, take this course.
This is a very practical introduction to robot arms. Suggest a topic within robotics that you are interested in to the professor and he will most likely accommodate your interests.
This course is extremely useful, on the more practical side. The course doesn't take that much time in the week and between the problem sets, the lab and the project you will have a great understanding of the material presented.
This course teaches very useful concepts for robotics but the best part was the presentations made by people working in the robotics field on different types of research.
The subject is worth knowing, but this class is seriously hard.  Be careful to take it during an easy semester.
It is a good class to start learning about robot modeling and control.
