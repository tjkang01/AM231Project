Good class for learning about different topics in robotics research.
Take it! Professor Howe is fantastic and super knowledgeable.
If you're interested in becoming a more informed, more capable robotics researcher, you should take this course!
Make sure you read the papers carefully each week and you will learn a lot.
This course was a great opportunity to interact with graduate students interested in relevant research fields, and to gain a better understanding of the challenges of research in MEMS fields. It was also a great chance to read several academic papers per week, ultimately strengthening my ability to understand paper expectations and how to write academic papers.
