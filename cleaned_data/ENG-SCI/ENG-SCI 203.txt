The material is interesting.  Brockett does a heroically bad job teaching.  His combination of lack of interest in the mundane details of the course like correcting errors in the notes, homeworks, and exams and refusal to use a textbook make the material difficult to learn than it needs to be in a way that a merely lazy professor couldn't hope to match.  Only take it if you really like the material and are willing to stomach a lot of unnecessary grief.
Having taken a course elsewhere on stochastic differential equations, this one was much better at teaching concepts intuitively with assignments that strengthened learning. Just watch out for the huge number of errors in the assignments and handouts.
thanks to this course, you know how to solve every problem
It is a good opportunity to take a course in a unique area with someone who pioneered this field.  However, students should go into the course expecting to encounter all of the administrative issues I mentioned.  Also, developing a good study group is a key to making it through this course.
