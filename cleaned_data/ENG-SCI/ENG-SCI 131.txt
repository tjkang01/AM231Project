This course is very hard if you don't have a strong math/physics background (differential equations, linear algebra, multivariable calculus, especially wave equations). Chris is available to help but doesn't seem to remember what it's like to not know how to do what he might consider "simple" math. Homeworks are alright to get through, unless there are extremely long assignments. The amount of time given to do each homework is very fair (10 days) and breaks up the pace of weekly psets assigned in other classes. Final exam was long, even though it was a takehome. Overall, I found that effort wasn't necessarily rewarded (i.e. you will probably not get an A just by working hard) but still an interesting topic and cool class.
Definitely interesting, and with the small class size Eli and Chris are very helpful, but at time scan be quite math heavy for an EPS class. Eli is great though, and very funny!
This course is fascinating but remember it's not about oceans but the physics behind water movement in the ocean. The lectures can be a bit derivation heavy but professor Tziperman is very entertaining. If you are comfortable with math 21a/21b and are interested in oceanography the workload is manageable and the field trip is really cool.
