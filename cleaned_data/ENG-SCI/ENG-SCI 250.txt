great introductory course to information theory. the course is well structured and the professor is patient and explains the material thoroughly.
Take this course if you are interested in an exciting research field that is useful in statistics, signal processing, and digital communications.
This course has the potential to be interesting. Although the instructor tries, he manages to confuse everyone and make the material much harder than it should be. The final/midterm also are a better test of test-taking abilities rather than mastery of the concepts.
This subject, in some sense, is one of the most fundamental of them all. If you are fascinated about the purely mathematical limits of communication (beyond physical), this is it.
