This class, including the materials, assignments, and everything, is a very difficult.  However, Professor Suo is a great lecturer, and I would highly recommend that anyone considering taking this class should definitely take it.  You will learn a lot from this course, and professor does a great job of giving a comprehensive view as opposed to just looking at plasticity.
It is a very fun course! Professor teaches in a very simple and enlightening way by illustrating many interesting examples, not only lengthy calculations. I think you can learn a lot about plasticity as well as topics in rheology in this class.
Best Professor I have ever had. Really enthusiastic and knowledgeable.
The most important thing I learned from this class is to try to think simply and find the core physical ideas of a problem. We should not be bothered too much by its complication or tedious mathematical calculation.
Prof Suo is one of the best teachers at Harvard and you'll be able to learn the concepts of Plasticity in this course.
The lectures are very worth attending. Listening to Zhigang is always fun and inspiring. The homework problems take some time.
This class is helpful for you to undestand the plastic behaviior of materials. It is a bridge between classical theories and some ongoing research, and may give you some inspiration of future research.
