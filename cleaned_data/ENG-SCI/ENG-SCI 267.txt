It's a great class if you do anything relating to aerosols, and it's flexible enough that you can really concentrate on what interests you.
Students should take a Socratic-type class like ES 267 during their studies.  This was a healthy complement to traditional lecture-style core courses.
I'd recommend that students take EPS 200 before taking this course, or have prior exposure to atmospheric chemistry. It's not necessary, but I think that those students who have taken an intro atmospheric chem course first will get more out of the course.
This course is practical for research purposes.  Professor Martin is an excellent lecturer and the small group made it fairly interactive and engaging.
The course is great! I learnt a lot through the class lectures and assignments.
