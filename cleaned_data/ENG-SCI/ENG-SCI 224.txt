The learning to work ratio is extremely high - I found the course extremely rewarding.
It is a great complement to the engineering and physical biology seminar class in the fall (MCB 225)
It is a good course for gaining exposure to how research is done in biophysics.  In would be useful in choosing a lab for a student who has not already, and provides additional prespective and skills to one who has.
Great class that you can learn techniques that you are interested in and that you won't learn from normal lab courses.
