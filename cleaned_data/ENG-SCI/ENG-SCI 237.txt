Excellent material with a great professor. It will take a lot of out-of-lecture reading to really understand it though.
really a great class overall and since this was only the first year I expected it to get better next year.  Robin overall did a pretty good job of explaining complicated concepts.  Sometimes things seem disjointed but they come together nicely at the end of the class.
