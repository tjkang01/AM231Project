Quantum is a beautiful subject that requires a strong background in both math and physics. Engineering quantum was particularly interesting, as this course related many of the concepts covered in a standard QM course (Physics 143a) to actual technology like quantum dots and waveguides. Homework was doable, but make sure you leave a lot of time for it. The more you put into this course, the more you'll get out of it.
If this course is offered again with Professor Majedi you should definitely take it if you're interested in Quantum Mechanics!! The course moves at a very fast rate so some sort of comfort level with the material would be good going in (try PS10). But you get to cover so much interesting material and it really does a great job conveying the potential applications of quantum mechanics to real world engineering problems. Great course overall.
