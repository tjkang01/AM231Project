This is one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.
This class is a challenge for sure. It seemed as though everyone thought it was quite difficult at times, but that is to be expected from engineering courses. It can require some extra learning on your own, and finding strategies for solving problems. Expect to be required to solve a lot of these problems without hand holding. The midterm is difficult, and the final project was fun but takes a lot of work. There is only one problem set every three classes, but they take a long time. Prepare to recalculate your answers quite frequently. The material is all really interesting though and opens a lot of doors to different parts of the space industry.
Awesome class. Very interesting material and not too difficult, but you still will learn a lot. You'll learn a lot of cool stuff about space missions.
This class is super fun if you are a space geek. It provides a great overview of all aspects of satellite engineering. It isnt much work but the work is super fun, because you are solving for real life problems.
This was an excellent class for anyone who is interested in Space Engineering.  It teaches a wide range of topics that allows students to dip their toes into every part of space exploration.
