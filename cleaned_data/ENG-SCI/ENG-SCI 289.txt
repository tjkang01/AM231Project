my reservations being, don't expect it to be a course you "take"... this is one you "do." So... if you're looking for a course to sit back and listen, maybe write a paper or whatever, this one's not for you.
This was a very interesting class. The subject matter is unique, and the experience of collaborating with students from very different fields was enriching. I would recommend it to students with initiative and a willingness to step outside your comfort zone into a new reference frame. The assignments are done as large groups, so be willing to work hard, support your teammates, and think outside the box.
