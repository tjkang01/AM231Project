Rachel and Katie make this class. Daniel is excited by the material and is a good lecturer -- clearly knows the material at an expert-level and is very effective at explaining concepts thoroughly. But the TFs are what make 133 a joy to take. Their sections explain the week's lectures in depth, and the practice problems are great to master the material and apply it on the problem sets. Problem sets are weekly, but any and all questions were answered at office hours, and sometimes parts of problems would be done on the board. Only downside of this course were the exams. Even though they were open note, they were just way too long for the allotted time (even three hours for the final -- a frantic three hours). Questions on the exams are not clear, and it made it evident that the problem sets were only doable because any confusions could be cleared up in section. Still, very interesting course material done in a great way. One of the best 130s.
If you like atmospheric science then you will love this course. A broad sweep of stratospheric and tropospheric problems and science
