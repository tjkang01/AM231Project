Really cool class, changed my opinion of solar cells.
If you have taken ES173 and are really interested in the physics governing different types of solar cells, then this class is perfect.  Otherwise the material may not interest you enough to warrant the time and effort.
Definitely take this course, but do know that you should take ES173 beforehand. Final project allows a nice opportunity to delve deeper into a topic and read interesting literature.
really great class to take for concentration credit. it won't drain you and chris really encourages in class discussion of the physics behind solar cell operation.
