find another way to learn this material. majedi's doesn't teach with clarity.
Keep up with the material with additional studying, because it ramps up very quickly after beginning. If you know Quantum Mechanics already, it probably won't be very difficulty for you, however.
This is the only class I've taken or heard about that goes in depth into the cycle of material design, entry into the environment and impacts on human health.
