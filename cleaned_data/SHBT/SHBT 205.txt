This course is an intensive scientific literature reading and essay writing course.
Expect to succeed in this course if you come in with a very strong background in neuroscience; otherwise, you'll spend time stressing over the minute details of certain papers and miss the forest for the trees.
The lectures contain a huge amount of information, but you will learn a lot!
This class is difficult, but doable. Keep on top of the theme paper readings and I would recommend writing a short summary of each paper after reading it to reduce the amount of work you have to do later. The final is tough! I would recommend going through previous tests and make sure you understand basic concepts from the lectures.
Discuss the papers with your classmates for their insight. It is next to impossible to understanding everything on your own.
You will get a broad and detailed overview of central auditory circuitry.
This class covers a broad range of material ranging from neuron-to-neuron interaction in the lower auditory pathway all they way to more abstract language process and psychoacoustics.
Great class with the masters of neural coding.
