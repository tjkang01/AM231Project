The topic may seem narrow, but you'll be surprised how much there is to learn about this amazing biological system.
Great class that really explores the depths of the inner ear. Highly recommend for anyone interested in the course
This course will give you an appreciation for the complexity and design of the inner ear for turning acoustic stimuli into neural impulses.
If you are confused about the material or confused on why your grades are not where you think they should be - find help from Dr. Liberman immediately. He will talk you through what he expects and gives suggestions on how to improve. There is a lot of material and if you do not have the biology background studying for this class may be challenging at first.
You will learn a lot, probably more than you are expecting to. And it's fun.
This is a great course if the material falls within your area of interest. If not, the topics can seem overly specific and some of the material may be too advanced for someone without a decent biology background.
This course was challenging but provided me opportunity to learn about the peripheral auditory system. I felt that the structure and instruction of this course provided every opportunity to rise up to that challenge.
This course is an opportunity to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the biology of the inner ear, and a strong introduction to current research in the field, what remains unknown (future directions of research), and exposure to the experimental methods available.
