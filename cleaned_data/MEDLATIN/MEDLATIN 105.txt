A wonderful experience that improves your ability to read Latin as well as your familiarity with research tools. Tuesday afternoons with Jan et al. were always a highlight of my week.
Professor Ziolkowski is great, and the text is very entertaining.  You also learn about some great tools for conducting research with Latin texts.
