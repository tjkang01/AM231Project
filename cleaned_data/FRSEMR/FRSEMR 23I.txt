This is a wonderful class for anyone interested in the science behind film. You will never watch a science fiction movie the same way after taking this class. Miakii is a wonderful instructor and clearly puts a lot of time into each class. I had a wonderful time, highlight of my freshman year.
This seminar was great because it provided me with a decent background in understanding natural phenomena and also was interesting and enjoyable.
best. seminar. ever.
This is such a fun and easy class, good way to get a taste of science in a unconventional and exciting way that is not overwhelming. Professor Miaki is also so much fun!
If you like movies and like science, you'll love this class. Also, Miaki is awesome because she really cares about the seminar and puts a lot of effort into making the class fun, hands on, and educational.
The class is fun and interesting. Professor Ishii is absolutely fantastic. She puts a ton of effort into preparing class each week and it really shows. It's a wonderful class, if you're on the fence about it you should definitely enroll.
Super fun, super easy!
If you like science and movies, this course is a must!
