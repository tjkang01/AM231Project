Definitely take this course. Professor Scarry is incredibly knowledgeable in a variety of fields and the readings are both challenging and enjoyable.
Professor Scarry is a lovely and fascinating person to take a class with, and the reading list for this class is excellent. You will write a lot in this class, but in a very low pressure environment, which I think is a very worthwhile and productive thing to do.
This course set me up with a quintessential outlook on Harvard academics--an amazing syllabus and professor.
The Call of Beauty was hands down my favorite class of freshman year. Professor Scarry is supportive, knowledgable, funny, articulate, and intelligent. Her genuine care and interest in the papers I submitted made me want to try even harder in the course, and increased my interest in the readings.
The class is interesting in its in depth study of beauty, however, it may be tedious if you are not committed to doing some extra work compared to the normal seminar.
Lots of reading but all interesting.
The readings touch upon many subjects ranging from Plato to works of the Middle Ages and present.
I loved this class.  It is not one where you need to be interested in the humanities (I'm interested in science) to appreciate the texts.  There is great diversity in the assigned readings/films.  Both a philosophical and a concrete approach to what makes something beautiful are used.  The course load was perfect for a freshman seminar class (not too light, but not too heavy).
I loved the freedom of this class. It's a great seminar because it feeds you interesting information in such a wonderful manner,and Professor Scarry is so wise on the subject.
This class is an interesting seminar on the topic of beauty. The readings are insightful.
Very fun course, interesting. Almost entirely discussion based, limited assignments. You learn plenty and explore readings you most likely won't explore in any other course! Would highly recommend.
