This is a unique seminar. The topic is unorthodox, original, and entertaining to study. The title may mislead you a bit--we didn't study jokes about music. We studied jokes integrated in music--funky notes, phrases, and patterns that composers wrote in their scores to amuse themselves and their audience. There is also a larger focus on the theories behind humor than I would have expected (which I liked). The workload is minimal: 1 reading a week (they're interesting) and only two written (~500 word) assignments all semester. There's a presentation at the end of the class that brings everything full-circle. Professor Clark has a unique sense of humor and you'll love getting to know her (she's the chair of the music department). Take this class regardless of your musical background and if you just want a chill class that will teach you about something you would have never realized otherwise.
Professor Clark is great at explaining the humor in music. She loves hearing the thoughts of the seminar and is open to any ideas about the listenings. She does a fantastic job of catering to musicians and non-musicians alike, so don't be afraid to take this class if you have no background in music.
If you know anything about classical music, this class is really interesting.
