A great, fun class with an awesome professor!
What you get from this course is what you put in, really depends on your interest in the topic and your ability to participate in discussions.
Gem of a seminar.  Ned is a really awesome and interesting professor that is flexible on content.  Very manageable workload.
Ned Hall is a wonderful teacher, and this is a very chill class.  He brings cookies every day and the discussions are always very engaging and interesting.
Ned's great, material is fun, cookies are often served!
This is a great seminar! I could not recommend it more.
