Take this class! It is a super fun seminar and Emily is so helpful. If you have any interest in Anthropology, photography, or any type of media, this class is a fun way to learn and think about these things.
This class starts slow but the material is pretty interesting. The assignments were very open-ended and creative. Overall, good class. Definitely check out the syllabus readings before taking because the course wasn't quite what I expected from the course description alone.
Do it if you are interested in museums, photos and representations.
This course is interesting, but the topic matter can get redundant and it also doesn't seem like what you signed up for.
This was a good class, not a blow-off Freshman Seminar but not a pile of work either. It strikes a good balance, about four articles to read per week. I might have taken it again if I had the opportunity. It's not all watching movies though, there's a lot of that but there's also a lot of critical analysis. Incidentally, Emily's area of interest is museums, and she showed us that museums can be pretty cool if you know what to look out for. She brought snacks too so that was a plus, haha. Don't know if it's still going to be offered, but it's definitely one to look out for if it is.
