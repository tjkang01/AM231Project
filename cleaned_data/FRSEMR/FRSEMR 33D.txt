Really enjoyable class. Was expecting it to be *about* drawing (history, conceptual borders, etc.) but it turned out to be mostly a studio class, which was nice. I meant for it to be my "buffer class", the one I could ignore when classes got intense, but it's really hard to make yourself walk away from a drawing before it's good enough! Katarina Burin and Melissa Krok-Horton are great teachers; they'll give you as much guidance or space as you need. Good class to take if you want to take an occasional afternoon or all-nighter off from other studies to make a big cool picture. Could also lead into additional serious VES coursework.
If you want a drawing class that will let you exercise your artistic freedom and foster your current skill set, this is the class.
Pass/fail art class! You literally can do nothing wrong here.
You learn so much and it a good way to have some planned de stress time
This class is a lot less about drawing and more about the ideas and implications of certain subject matters in drawings. Thats something to be aware of before you take this.
I would tell students enrolling in this course to be prepared for a considerable amount of preparation that goes into each class, and for a consistent amount of weekly work that can be somewhat time-consuming.
You will get a lot out of this course if you are emotionally invested in your pieces--it shows if you are putting energy into them
