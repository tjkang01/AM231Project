You will read a great mix of modern literature and classic stories (Horatio Alger, Fitzgeralds). This seminar does have more papers assigned than others but the topics are interesting.
this was a very interesting class, and i took it because i thought the topic sounded great, and fun to study. however, i was completely unprepared for how much work this class would require (especially compared to other freshman seminars which require very little work). the professor was knowledgable and i really liked her, but just know that you will have to spend a lot of time on this course.
Loved this seminar. It was definitely worth taking.
great course for english loving students
