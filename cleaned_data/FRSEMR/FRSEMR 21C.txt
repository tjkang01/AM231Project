You will learn a lot in this course, but the course is structured to be kind of dull. While the material is fascinating and I don't regret taking this class, the course didn't stand out to me as fantastic.
Professor Berger is an incredible astronomer and incredibly knowledgeable about this subject! I would recommend taking this class if you have an interest in pursuing Astronomy as a concentration or a secondary.
This class is a nice class on astronomy and the professor is a great gateway help for further astronomy but the class is not very intense in terms of how deep it goes into astro.
It's not a lot of work until the end of the semester and you learn an incredible amount of interesting things.
