This class was a great freshman seminar. Learning about the folktales is super fun and Professor Innes is super passionate and incredibly knowledgeable about the subject matter. The class is not very time consuming work wise and the readings are generally interesting.
Material is ok but lectures are really boring.
This class was a lot of fun and very interesting, but you get back what you put in.  If you do the readings and contribute, you will learn a lot and have a great time.  If you don't, you will be fine but won't get the full enjoyment.
