I really enjoyed this class. Wendy is really concerned about fostering an interesting discussion about the material. The work is super manageable, and although there wasn't as much as in other classes, I still felt like I learned so much about Asian American literature and also about myself and my own perceptions. It's less focused on writing papers all the time, and more focused on deep thinking and exploration. If you want to take a class to learn without the stress (some freshman seminars have slightly stressful workloads) , this is certainly it.
