This is a fun, non-stressful, and interesting freshman seminar.

Such a fun class!
I would tell them of the history dimension of the course as opposed to a focus on modern predictive systems.
This class is the best. The professor was so nice and personable. Going to this seminar made my Wednesday's something to look forward to. I loved getting to know the professor and my classmates in such a small environment. This course also opened up some really cool opportunities because the professor is helping head the creation of a new online Harvard course- so join the class and become a part of it!
This freshman seminar was so much fun. Each week felt as though we were meeting up for a dinner discussion rather than for an actual class and I personally really enjoyed learning about different models in finance, epidemiology, and astrophysics.
This was the first year of the course so it was somewhat unorganized and geared towards developing the edX version. I would definitely recommend it for next year if you have any interest in prediction. It is pretty in depth-spanning from ancient techniques to modern simulation and the material is solid.
This is just a great class to take to learn a variety of interesting topics with not a lot of work
Really fun and interesting course. We discussed a wide variety of topics which kept it interesting all semester.
