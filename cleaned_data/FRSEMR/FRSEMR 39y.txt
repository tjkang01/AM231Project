Take this class if you wish to be better.
Professor Sacks is amazing. He has wonderful insights on the poems and encourages students to share their perspectives. This class was the perfect freshman seminar experience.
Take this course, it is by far my favorite class of my Freshman Fall.
This is an incredible class if you have any interest in poetry at all, and even if you don't really have interest in poetry. Peter Sacks is a wonderful man, whose enthusiasm will make you love whatever you're learning. He is incredibly thoughtful and kind, and loves to get to know his students individually. He leaves a lot of room for students to participate and help craft the curriculum, and encourages initiative in helping lead the course throughout the year. This is the kind of class that shows you exactly why you should take a freshman seminar.
