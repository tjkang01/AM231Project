This is an excellent and highly enjoyable freshman seminar. There is probably more work in this course than in the average freshman seminar, but as long as you are interested in the topics covered, I would very much recommend it.
A great course for those who are interested in the subject matter.  The time commitment is perhaps a bit more extensive than would normally be expected from a seminar, but is definitely worth it.  The MATLAB and statistics skills learned in the class are very applicable to other contexts as well.
