interesting if you are passionate about speaking, politics, or american history. It's a nice freshman seminar that is not too hard.
Read everything and initiate conversations during class time. You will learn a lot about politics and rhetoric.
Take this class; it's amazing.
Be ready to read philosophy-- that was the hardest part of the class for me.
This is a gem and will give you some really amazing discussions on topics that may be difficult to talk about otherwise.
This is a fantastic seminar. I absolutely recommend it! Prof. Sandel creates an encouraging and engaging class environment, and class participation is the majority of the class. If you like thinking conceptually about politics, want to learn more about what makes an effective speech, or are interesting in the more philosophical/ethical side of speechmaking, this is the freshman seminar for you! Rewarding, interesting, engaging class.
