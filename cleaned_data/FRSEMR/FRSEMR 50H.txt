Be prepared to learn about a lot of very different disciplines relating to the Biology of Movement! A great class if you aren't sure how much you like biology but want to learn more about the topics in the course description.
Have fun learning about specific aspects of biology and physics. It is one of those subjects that thoroughly answers the question "how will this be used in real life?".
This is such an interesting course! Especially for the amount of work required (very little), you learn so much about all different types of movement. It's very thorough but also touches upon a lot of topics; Professor Biewener is very knowledgeable and even takes you to his lab at the end of the course (where he does research on animal movements) Sometimes, the classes are a little dry, as they are very lecture-based, but the topics are incredibly interesting, so if you want to learn more about movement, this is definitely the course for you
Good class, cool teacher, interesting content, just kind of boring
