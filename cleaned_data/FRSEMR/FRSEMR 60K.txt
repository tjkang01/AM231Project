It was wonderful being able to travel to so many different places i Boston. The course will be great if you have an interest in medieval literature. We spent more time talking about Proust, however.
Take this class! Even if you are not interested in Proust or medieval literature, you will enjoy doing the readings in this very low-stress environment. Virginie and Hannah are incredibly kind, sympathetic, and knowledgeable instructors. You get the opportunity to reflect, which you don't do enough of in other classes. Plus, the class goes to a different place every week, and the trips off-campus are nice ways of getting out of the Harvard bubble.
