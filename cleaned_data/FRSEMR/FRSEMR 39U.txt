Professor Stebbins' course is an accessible and interesting introduction to art historical analysis and to American painting.
If you like art then this is the class for you, if not then I would not suggest it.
This is a great introduction into American art led by a leading curator who knows a lot about the art.
Do the readings in order to fully participate in class discussions
You don't need a specific background, take it if you have any interest in art history. This is a great way to dip a toe into the topic. Also a great way to study the US through an interesting lens.
