If you like movies and/or history this is the course for you
Take this seminar if you have an interest in film! You'll watch a variety of movies and learn to watch more critically.
This is really a fantastic class. You get to watch some great films and learn to look at them with a critical eye.  Really the only assignments each week are watching the film, and that's really a pleasure.  Class discussions are great, and the class presentation format is really spectacular.
Lots of fun, Danny is great at encouraging discussion
A lot of fun and a great way to learn more about historical films instead of watching Mean Girls every time you want to watch a movie.
Fun section and you get a lot of exposure to cool movies you would likely not see otherwise, but be prepared for 3-5 hours of work outside of class per week.
Definitely a great freshman seminar to go for. You get to see a lot of great movies and learn a lot more about the historical context of them.
This movies of this course are really fun to watch and provide a really good break from the routine studying that most classes have.
