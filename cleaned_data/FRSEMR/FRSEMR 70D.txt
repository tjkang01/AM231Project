if you enjoy history you'll love this, even if not you'll enjoy it and get a lot out of it.
I enjoyed this course. If you're someone who enjoys doing research in Widener or on campus, you'll like this course. But if you don't like doing research and/or you don't like WWII history, you might end up feeling kind of lost, and it is easy to lose investment in the class because the workload is so low. Making the presentations is fun and it's a very easy workload. Erez knows his stuff and is a great professor, but since it's a freshman seminar it's not worth taking it if you don't love the subject matter.
Best course I've taken at Harvard
I would recommend this class to anyone who really wants to know if history is the right field for them--if you leave this class wanting to pursue history, I think its a surefire sign that you should. This class is rigorous for a freshman seminar, in my opinion, because it requires weekly presentations and countless trips to the stacks in Widener to find material for the next class/a lot of time to gather your material and make a thoughtful contribution to class. I would say that though this might be more work than other seminars, the research skills I learned here will definitely help me throughout my college experience. Take this class!
