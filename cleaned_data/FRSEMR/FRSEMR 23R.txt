Dr. Alcock is a great teacher and does a wonderful job of catering the course to the class's need. He also brings in really good cookies every week, which is a plus. The only downside is the same downside of any seminar class, the experience is only as good as the students in the section.
As a freshman seminar it's a great fourth class to take on a tough workload. The final project is what it all builds up too, but the project itself isn't too demanding even. The only criticism I have for the class is the time but it's necessary. Take it.
Don't take this class unless you're actually interested in astrophysics. I took the course hoping it would be a relaxing class where I'd get to look into space with the telescopes and it ended up being a lot of really dull math.
This course was great to take as a humanities concentrator who would not invest in taking a very serious astrophysics or astronomy class but is still very curious about those topics.
