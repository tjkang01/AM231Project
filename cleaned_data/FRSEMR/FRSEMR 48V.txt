This is an amazing course that will change your view about East Asian Politics and how we refer to "rogue states." My view on world politics is greatly changed, and I now feel able to make suggest general recommendations for policy.
Definitely take this class, the professor is great and the course is very interesting.
There is quite a bit of reading in this course so be prepared for that.
