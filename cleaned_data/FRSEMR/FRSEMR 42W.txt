It will never be offered again.
I don't know if Professor Darnton will ever teach this course again, but it was UNBELIEVABLE. You get to touch the Gutenberg bible, look at incredible rare books, and learn from the book master Professor Darnton. TAKE THIS CLASS (if it's ever offered again!)
(Although Professor Darton will not be offering this class in the future) I will tell future students that this was one of the most special classes I have taken thus far at Harvard. Professor Darton is a legend in the academic world, and being able to get to know him in such an intimate and relaxed environment was incredible.
