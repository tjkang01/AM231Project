Robin is so cool!! This class is fun, and you learn a lot + get exposed to a ton of opportunities. It's not a huge time commitment and you get a lot out of it.
Of the 8 classes I took my freshman year, I think that this one was the best and most meaningful.
This course is fantastic, Robin is extremely enthusiastic and so much fun and the material covered by the course is both specific and in depth but also very relevant and applicable to a lot of things. The class atmosphere is really a lot of fun, and the field trips to the arboretum and to the bee hives were very interesting.
Robin is an awesome professor! This is one of the smallest seminars for sure and Robin and everyone in the seminar really fostered a sense of community. We went to a lot of places that I would've never gone to by myself (e.g. Arnold Arboretum and the beehives on campus). Robin is super approachable, nice and is a great teacher. 100% recommend to anyone who is interested in biology or just wants to admire beautiful flowers and plants!
This might have been my favorite course freshman year! Robin's enthusiasm and passion for plants made for fascinating discussions about plant-pollinator interactions and the reproductive cycle in plants. Going to class was a highlight of my week, every week, and I am so glad that I took this course. You probably have to be at least somewhat interested in plants to enjoy this course, although I feel like anyone who is interested in biology or genetics or ecology would find this course fascinating as well. I took this class alongside LS 1b, and I found that we would discuss certain topics about evolution and genetics in this class often weeks before it was covered in LS 1b lectures, and covered in more depth, too. Excellent class, 10/10 would recommend.
