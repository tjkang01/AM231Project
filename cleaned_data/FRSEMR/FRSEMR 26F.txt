This class is awesome and especially interesting if you have crazy dreams and want to make some sense of them.
Dreams are very common and people don't really put much thought into them. However, this course gives you insight into just how amazing dreams are and what our minds are capable of.
If you are looking for classes you can only take in Harvard, this is it. Be ready to learn about dreams and dream psychology across time, space and world cultures. Be ready to be spellbound.
Be prepared to have all your preconceived notions shattered! This class challenged what I knew and inspired me to change my day-to-day sleeping and waking habits. I began keeping a dream journal, indulged in incubation techniques, and couldn't stop telling all my peers about the experience. TAKE THIS SEMINAR!!
At times the class seems a little vague and aimless, and if you're not really interested in learning about dreams and how they come about/across/how they're used then this may not be the class for you. It has to be more than a passing interest, more than "Oh I had a cool dream that one time..."
This class is enjoyable if you really like the material. If not, then it may not be so.
This class is so interesting and is great for anyone who has weird dreams or is interested in dreams in general.
