This class is interesting if you like the topic. Don't take it just to take a seminar though.
It is a great course to get you familiarized with college discussions as a freshman,
This course gives great exposure to the many issues surrounding the US Energy Revolution through its readings, the guest speakers' knowledge, and of course Professor Stock's own firsthand experiences. It doesn't have a heavy workload yet I still felt like I walked out having learned a lot, so if it's offered again I would highly recommend it.
It's awesome and everyone should take it.
This is not a light freshman seminar. The content is heavy and detailed.
It's an informational class that exposes you to the economics behind environmental policy as well as allows you to challenge current thought about the pros and cons of certain environmental policy approaches. The discussions allowed me to learn more about different perspectives and different knowledge.
If you're at all interested in energy and how both the government and private sector deal with energy problems for the future, take this class. It's a good way to get a lot of information about energy topics and about how the government works, because Professor Stock has so much experience about both areas and is open to questions about those areas. That being said, what you get out of this course depends on the time you put into it, so take the time to do some of the readings if you really want to understand the discussion and ask questions.
