Ezer was a great teacher who facilitated wonderful discussion. The class is not a ton of work besides the final paper, but you get out of it what you put in! Cocaine is a really interesting topic to learn about and there are a ton of ways to approach it, so I would really recommend this class!
The course material was extremely engaging and covered a wide range of topics that I would have never expected to have been covered. Professor was great at facilitating discussions and playing devils advocate. I really enjoyed the course and highly recommend it.
