It's a fun class, and you'll learn a lot.
It's a very interesting course if you're interested in the subject matter, and the field trip was excellent.
This is a really great course for people who like birds and/or dinosaurs and want to get to know the zoology resources at Harvard. Overall, this course is really fun (we got to take a field trip to the Museum of Natural History in NY!) and has a very low workload, and you get to have access to the amazing bird and fossil collections at Harvard. Professor Edwards is an extremely nice and chill professor and it was a lot of fun to take a course with him. I do wish we could have done a bit more in the course, but this was the first time this course was offered, and if it gets offered again, I'm sure it can only get better and more organized in the future.
The class is a fun exploration of avian evolution and I feel like I learned a considerable amount. Having very little background in the sciences, I was still able to participate in and enjoy the class. Professor Edwards is very likable and urges students to come to the class stress-free and keep in mind that the course is not taken for a grade and should be focused on fun.
It's a very fun and interesting course if you like dinosaurs and birds! However, if you aren't interested in those two things, then don't take the course.
Great class, you will enjoy it and learn a lot, especially if you love dinosaurs
This course was a great break from the busyness of p-set and essay classes, as seminars are meant to be. Professor Edwards is a calming presence. We also had amazing opportunities, such as a trip to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, running PCR, examining bird remains and various skeletons in the MCZ collections, and Skyping with famous paleontologists around the world. I recommend this class to anyone who's selecting a seminar and has an interest in dinosaurs (of which birds are a subset, of course) and evolution, especially phylogenetic trees.
