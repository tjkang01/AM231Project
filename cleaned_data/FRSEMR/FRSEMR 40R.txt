It is a very intriguing course.
The class is NOT ABOUT NETWORKING!!! It is about social networks. If you are looking to become a better networker, like I was, then this class might not be for you. However, if you ride it out like I did, you'll realize how passionate Prof. Small is about the topic and actually how interesting the nature of social networks is.
This class was fantastic! The class is very much discussion-based. Pretty standard workload for a freshman seminar. Professor Small is excellent and you should really get to know him!
Professor Small is the nicest and most interesting and engaging professor. You can tell he is extremely smart. There is a lot of reading for the class but it is not always necessary to do all of the readings in-depth to know what is going on in class.
