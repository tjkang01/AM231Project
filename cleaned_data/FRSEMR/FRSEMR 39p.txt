Vierba is a very very engaging and knowledgeable instructor. He will take you through the ins and outs of the curriculum, leaving you with questions to ponder both in class with your peers and after class on your own. Definitely worth taking if you are interested in Latin American History and (to a lesser extent) Literature, plus the how colonialism/imperialism was and is still being manifested.
FRES39 is a unique course in that it's highly self-driven and it is what you make of it. The discussions define the class in many ways, with the subject material being drawn from various sources and traditions.
The readings for this class were very interesting and whats great about them is that they are primary sources, so you get to read about the travel adventures of the people actually doing the traveling. You learn a lot about the motivations behind travel writing and how Europe responded to the literature. Overall, the class was very enjoyable. Ezer knows a lot about Latin American history and he has interesting travel stories to tell. Most of the films we watched in class were great too.
