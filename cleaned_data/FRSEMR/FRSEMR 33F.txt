This is a great class! Very helpful for transitioning to college as it isn't too much work, but involves an intimate setting with multiple professors, who are enthusiastic and engaging.
It is a very good introductory class to philosophy. There are no philosophy papers but there is a lot of discussion about the philosophical ideas presented in the readings. The class will also improve your ability to analyze arguments and formulate your own opinion.
