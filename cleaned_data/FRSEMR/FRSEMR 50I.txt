Definitely recommend if you are at all interested in astronomy. Taking a class from Prof Grindlay is a great opportunity, and getting to use the Clay telescope for observations is really cool.
This is a very good class if you are interested in observing, astronomy, and/or astrophysics.
You will definitely get more out of this seminar if you already have at least some familiarity with physics, but even if you've never taken a physics course before it is still a great way to start familiarizing yourself with some of the topics studied in astrophysics.
