It was very interesting and would be a good addition to a pre-med student's schedule because of the bioethics the course considered.
This is an interesting class, especially if you are interested in World War II, and Germany. It has a large focus on history, but the ethical discussions are interesting, and one of the highlights of the course is the final presentations, from which you can learn a lot about certain ethical dilemmas that are important to your classmates.
This course has definitely been one of the highlights  of my freshman experience at Harvard. This course will introduce you to a realm of historical and ethical analysis that might be new and fascinating for most students; the skills that students learn to apply in this class (research, ethical debate, discussion of the past) will prove to be valuable in many future courses and in life in general. In addition, the course will help students better understand the period of National Socialism in Germany, making students more aware of certain topics that could serve them outside of the classroom and beyond Harvard. Enrolling in this seminar was the best decision I made throughout my first semester in college.
This course really makes you think about some major issues, and it provides for some fascinating thought and discussion. The work is very manageable, especially when taken with more difficult, time-consuming classes.
This course is very nice for people who love to have engaging discussions.
