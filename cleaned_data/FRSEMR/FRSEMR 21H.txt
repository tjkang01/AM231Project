All that's necessary is an interest in the material.
This class is what you make of it.  If you carefully go through the readings then you will get a lot out of the class.
This course is great if you love discussion with others about medical topics and ethical topics. Also, Rich is a great teacher with a lot of passion and knowledge about cardiovascular disease, and his stories with patients or research were always entertaining. Rich is also very caring and understanding, and he is representative of what Harvard faculty should be like.
It opened my eyes to how our society influences medicine and the quality of care that individuals receive.
Take this course if you are interested in being pre-med.
Dr. Lee is very knowledgeable and genuinely cares about his work; he definitely influences you to think deeper about problems in the world. If you have an interest in heart disease or in the medical field, this seminar would be a relaxing environment to explore and discuss on those topics.
This class is really interesting for anyone interested in public health and how society intersects with modern cardiology. Really interesting readings, but be ready to spend at least a couple hours per week digesting the material, as the readings can be pretty dense. Definitely worth doing the reading though. Plus the visit to the catheterization lab/cardiovascular center at the end of the semester is really fascinating!
Definitely do this if you're pre-med. If you aren't, it's not the best seminar in the world, honestly. it is interesting to learn something new, but there are so many readings, that you might not be engaged enough if you don't really love it.
This is a great seminar! The articles were extremely interesting, and I learned a lot more about the field of cardiology and the heart. Rich is an amazing professor and also gives excellent advice!!!
Professor Lee is a really nice person and is really open to getting to know students!
