This freshman seminar (50L - Quantum Entanglement) was a lot of fun! We actually learned quite a bit of quantum mechanics and quantum computing (more than I was expecting)! Professor Sachdev is a wonderful person and very clear teacher!There's one final presentation at the end of the course on a topic of your choice related to quantum mechanics. I really enjoyed researching and creating my presentation and watching my peers' presentations. Overall, I would highly recommend this seminar!
It was a really fun seminar and served as a great intro to quantum information and quantum computing, subjects which are not normally covered in an undergraduate curriculum. Professor Sachdev is awesome!
Linear Algebra is key. If you don't have at least some background in linear algebra, it's going to be very difficult for you. And quantum mechanics is a bit confusing and not intuitive. Be wary of taking this course unless you are serious about learning about quantum mechanics; this is not a course to take just to say "I'm taking Quantum Entanglement".
its fun! good if you don't know anything about quantum to begin with
The seminar is great :) Professor Sachdev does a good job covering multiple applications on quantum entanglement. It can be a little long from time to time as there are a lot of abstract mathematics, but it is fun and there are no assignments.
Prof. Sachdev is a wonderful person, extremely knowledgeable, open-minded and approachable and during the seminar, we not only got to do a lot of calculations for understanding, but had the opportunity to look at the quantum physics labs in Harvard and relevant experiments that are being done currently. Highly recommend for those who don't fear math and are willing to learn more about quantum entanglement (who better to learn from?)!
