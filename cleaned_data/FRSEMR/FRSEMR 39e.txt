Emma and Michael are great professors, and you will be taught a lot, but you really have to motivate yourself internally. There's really no assignments and if you don't do the readings, you probably won't gain a whole lot out of it and discussion will be boring.
This is a great class. Take it. Great people, great material.
Literally, this class is awesome. I took it as a fifth class, and it was one of the best decisions I have ever made. Even though I don't have a whole lot of interest in Rome or China, the professors make the whole course worth it. It is very little work outside of class, yet you get so much out of it. Both professors care so much about each student, and really want to have a good time!
Take it.  You won't regret it.  If you have any interest in Classical Rome, Han China, or both, this course will be a fun addition to your schedule.
This is a really thought-provoking and generally fun seminar! Emma and Michael are both very enthusiastic about their respective empires and love to joke around as if they were still living in them. A fun class outing to the MFA made this class even more awesome.
This is a very chill freshman seminar. You get to be very close with two amazing, awesome professors, and have a great time.
Emma and Michael are truly the best. We had class outside multiple times (with ice cream breaks!) and took a marvelous field trip to the MFA. Discussions were free flow, fun, and did not require doing a lot of preparation for class. Great!
Professors Dench and Puett are inspiring. Take this class.
This seminar is extremely chill; just reading every week with a final project at the end. There's no weekly writing assignments, which was the wonder of it because you can just read and enjoy the material rather than dwell upon what questions need to be answered.
I highly doubt that you will find a more entertaining course at Harvard. We laughed as we learned, and Michael and Emma made complex aspects of ancient societies easily memorable.
