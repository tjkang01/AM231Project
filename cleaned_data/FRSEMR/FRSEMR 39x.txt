Lectures were very tedious and not that interesting. Take this if you want a really light workload.
If you like ballet, it gives you a lot of good watching and reading material.  The actual class isn't great, though.
Take it. You will learn a lot with regards to the growth of ballet. The field trip is so much fun and the fact that is a freshman seminar graded PASS/FAIL means there is less weight on your shoulders.
If you don't like ballet, and the idea of having to watch a recorded performance per week doesn't appeal to you, this is not for you. If that does sound fun, it's not too big of a time commitment, and the perspective is interesting.
This is an excellent way to learn a lot about ballet if you are enthusiastic about it. The workload is pretty light during the week: the assignments consist mostly of watching ballets, which can take up a few hours, and a few readings.
