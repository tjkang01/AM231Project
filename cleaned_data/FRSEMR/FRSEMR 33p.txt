A good class if you like philosophy- readings every week are boring unless you are actually interested in the subject matter.
This class has very interesting reading materials which help you develop a position on difficult, subjective matters.
Can be quite dry.
This class will stretch your mind, but don't expect to sit in class and not interact with the reading and teacher and still enjoy it.
This is a great class if you would like a low-intensity introduction to philosophy!
I would really really like to give this course a 5 because it's clear that Professor Chen dedicates a significant amount of time to preparing course materials, lecture notes, and essay feedback. Moreover, she is very approachable and lucid in explanations. That being said, the course is a seminar. I found that the quality of discussions depended highly on how committed everyone was to doing the readings. After a few weeks, it seemed like this quality and commitment dwindled until people just zoned out.
