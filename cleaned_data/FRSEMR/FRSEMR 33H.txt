It's great! It would help, though, if you're interested in the subject matter and like museums. Classical antiquities might be uninteresting to some.
You will not regret taking this seminar. It is all I hoped it would be, and Dr. Staehli places learning and appreciation above boredom work. Never did I feel that I was being asked to do something that was not directly improving my knowledge of antiquities and museums. Everything is relevant, and everything is interesting.
This class is very interesting and teaches you a lot about museums and their set-up.
I loved going to this class and listening to Professor Staehli speak about a subject you can tell he loves. Be warned- this is not a seminar but a lecture class with very little discussion. If you do not have a real interest in art history, don't bother taking this class. The majority of my class was obviously uninterested in the material which detracted from my experience. I enjoyed what I learned in this class but with a lot of frustration about the learning environment.
