This focus of this seminar was very interesting to me.  I enjoyed looking closely at a few monuments from Rome, Constantinople, and Ravenna and discussing how these monuments reflected the time period and culture of their creators.  This seminar was a wonderful fusion of ancient history and art history.
I would only recommend if you are actually very interested in the subject matter. Keep in mind it is 2 hours a week looking at byzantine architecture.
Prof. Kalavrezou creates a great and comfortable learning environment. Be careful to latch onto as many tidbits of information as you can.
Unless you're very interested in the material, you probably won't find it very engaging.
Be careful with taking the class--Ms. Kalavrezou is super nice but sometimes the material can get a bit dull. Well, it can get very dull. Dull as heck.
