This class is basically exactly what I wanted from a freshman seminar. It led to interesting reading and awesome discussions with considerably less stress than a normal class.
This course is essentially about the in class debates and discussing moral issues so if you enjoy that, you'll love this class! But you also learn a lot of cool and interesting things as well!
It is a fantastic class just be aware it is more biologically based than one might anticipate from reading the description
The teacher is phenomenal. The topics are great and the class really engages you in discussion. This is THE SEMINAR.
Only do it if you're interested. It's a class that interrelates science and humanities very well.
The focus is on the evolutionary reasons for human/animal (specifically chimps and bonobos for a while) violent behavior. If you're interested in the psychology or evolution of why we fight (rather than the history of warfare) I highly recommend the course. Prof. Wrangham is a bit intimidating, but definitely an expert in the field.
If you are interested in human evolution, then this is the course for you. The course intimately explores why humans are both violent and peaceful, which was very enlightening for me as someone interested in human nature.
Take this seminar. It's with a great and engaging professor who is knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the topic. It's not a lot of work at all and there is a definite emphasis on your enjoyment of the course.
