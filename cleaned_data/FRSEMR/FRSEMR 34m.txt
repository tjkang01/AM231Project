Get excited for an unforgettable course. This class will teach you a lot about something you probably know little about - the life and work of a great American composer, conductor, and activist. By studying Bernstein, you will gain a greater understanding of his world (that of the twentieth century) and of the progression of music in the twentieth century. It's an extremely enjoyable and educational class. Professor Oja does a fantastic job teaching this course.
