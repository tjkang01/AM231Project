Dr. Nelson was a wonderful professor and the class was interesting while not time consuming.
If you have any interest in the human brain and human behavior then I highly recommend this class.
Professor Nelson is a great member of Harvard faculty. He has done prominent research in the area of foster care and has a lot of person experiences to share!
A great class if you are interested in psychology. Really in depth and student driven, will require work though.
This course has a very interesting topic but Dr. Nelson doesn't teach most of it; it's almost entirely student presentations. There's also a ton of reading and writing assigned for a freshman seminar, and not all of it seems necessary or enlightening in any way.
The seminar was awesome and very interesting
