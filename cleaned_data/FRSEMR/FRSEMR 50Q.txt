This was the first year this seminar was offered and I'm really glad I took it. The experiments weren't without their fair share of problems, but the great thing was that this gave us experience with what to do and how to interpret results when things don't go the way we expect. Professor Balskus and the TFs Ben and Carina are amazing and did a great job with the course. Would definitely recommend, especially if you have no prior research experience.
You will certainly gain hands-on lab experience, which is very useful! Learning about the microbiome is particularly interesting, as it is a "hot topic" right now. Professor Balskus and the rest of the teaching staff is wonderful. Professor Balskus gives great feedback, is enthusiastic about her work, and is great to talk to and bounce ideas off with. Some of the lab parts of the class overlap with lab assignments in LS1b, but learning how to write a proposal and present a scientific poster are things you will learn in FS50Q that you won't learn in many of your other classes. And you'll get to work with great teaching staff!
I loved this class. I knew nothing about microbiomes before taking this class; I'd never even heard of it. Now, I'm looking at labs where I could continue studying microbiomes. This class, compared to other freshman seminars, feels like it requires more work. This would also feel very true when you are drowning in work from your other classes. But, if you ever need anything, don't hesitate to reach out to Professor Balskus. She is not only a great professor but is also a great person. Go to her office hours!
I would strongly recommend this course to students interested in the microbiome and developing laboratory and research skills. The workload for this class is very light and the course staff are really helpful.
