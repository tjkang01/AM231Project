This course gives you a great background in both the classic texts of development theory (Smith, Marx, Weber), and newer books.  It is a privilege to be able to discuss these ideas with Professor Kremer.
Professor Kremer is so well-versed in the subject, and development is such an important issue. If you're new to the subject, this is a great primer. If you've done a bit of reading before, the class may tread old ground
My boy Mike Kremer is really cool, great guy overall---Really take this seminar
Be prepared for lively and educated discussion that connects broad economic philosophy from the past to current, data-driven economic research.
Great course to take if interested in developmental economics. Professor Kremer is great at leading meaningful discussions and I definitely walked away knowing a lot more than I did before.
