This was a fantastic seminar, definitely one of the highlights of my spring. The work isn't too much and the two hours are over in the blink of an eye.
This was my favorite class this semester. Rani is an amazing discussion facilitator. I only wished the class was longer, because of how great the discussions were.
This class is good! The books are good! What a good class.
