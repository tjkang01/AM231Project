Take this class! I feel like I learned a lot about African American political thought throughout the years and a lot of the issues that were raised by the autobiographies are issues that are still relevant today e.g. Black Lives Matter. Tommie Shelby is super smart and friendly, and it was great to be able to spend time with him every week to talk about the autobiographies.
