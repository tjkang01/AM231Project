This is a fantastic course, brushes you up with skills vital to critical thinking, drawing links, and gives an excellent foundation to fields such as philosophy, literature, history, logic, political science, and many others. There are several Freshman seminars to choose from, but this is a clear first choice.
This class is a great introduction to German literature and philosophy.
This is a course for all students with any level of interest in German literature and philosophy whatsoever.  For students who have had no previous experience, Professor Hamilton leads you through the difficult field in much the same way Vergil leads Dante through the Inferno: yes, it gets hot at times and you meet with figures from the past that are terrifying at the outset, but you can take comfort in the fact that Professor Hamilton can get you out of even the most complex philosophers. And for those who have had experience, Professor Hamilton draws in nuanced readings and many cross-references that weave all of the authors and philosophers together.  I will not slip into hyperbole and say that "everyone needs to take this course" like many of the Q-guide reviews. This is for people who want to learn about a culture through its literature and philosophy: how the country was and is shaped by these people.  Being a sat/unsat course, it also lets students just LEARN and not worry about grades like so many at Harvard do constantly.
