It is pleasant (but occasionally irritating) that this class does not require very much work
You'll either love it or hate it
The class can get very difficult but there is little to no homework so it is not very demanding. If you're interested in the topic, go for it. You'll learn a lot and Mr. Mahadevan really makes you think about certain ideas. However, if you're not that interested, do not take this class; it will bore you to death.
very interesting and fun class
This class does not require much work, since it is a seminar. If you are able and interested to understand math and probability at a high level, it would probably be a great fit. If not, you'll have a lot of trouble keeping up.
