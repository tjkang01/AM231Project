The material for the class is interesting, but you will get much more out of the readings than you will out of the class sessions. The class really never could decide whether it was more focused on historical context or straight musical analysis. It was a paralysis of indecision.
It's loads of fun! The readings are interesting, the music is great and Prof van Orden is extremely knowledgeable if you get her going properly.
This was an amazing seminar.  Professor Van Orden is exceptional - dedicated, smart, enthusiastic, and kind.  The material is great - if you love music, california, or the 60's ... this is the best class to take! One of my favorite classes I have taken at Harvard.  It is a lot of fun and I doing the readings and listenings was really fun! Take this class!!!!
This class was absolutely fantastic. Professor van Orden is wonderful and very helpful, plus you will be introduced to (or reacquainted with) some really fantastic music.
Take it!
A nice, musical break in the week from real classes.
This course was a lot of fun. Professor Van Orden facilitates really good discussions about interesting topics, you listen to great 60s music, and she brought fresh fruit almost every week.
It you are genuinely interested in California, music, and the 60's take this class.  If you aren't, then don't.  The material is easier to follow if you take a genuine interest and pursue learning outside of the class.
