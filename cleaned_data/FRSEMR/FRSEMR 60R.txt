The professors are absolutely amazing and this class will introduce you to all aspects of business, dating back to the 2000s BCE.
This class (at least the first iteration that I took) is extraordinarily easy. I came into it with three goals in mind: getting to know the professors, getting to know other students in a seminar-style environment, and having a relatively easy class to balance out my workload/schedule. Largely, all three things were true: the professors are really great and the discussions we had were pretty good. However, the class was so ridiculously easy that I honestly felt bad for most of the semester because it seemed like I was wasting a class slot. I got over myself in the end, and I think I took a lot more out of it than I had initially expected. If you are taking three other insanely difficult courses, or considering this as your fifth class, then I would definitely recommend it.
This is an amazing class and I think it's unlikely that you'll be able to get this mix of content in any other class at Harvard.
Wonderful class meant to broaden one's economics style of thought.
This class was wacky but an absolute blast. Gojko and Eugene are awesome. They tell wonderful stories, and the best part of seminar is just listening to them ask each other questions, make fun of each other, swap stories, and answer our most random questions about ancient and modern economics. Highlights were visiting the HBS archives and the Semitic Museum. Readings could sometimes be a bit dry, but they really came to life when Eugene and Gojko started talking about them in section. The modern/ancient parallel was sometimes strained and occasionally felt disjointed, but overall a fun, rewarding learning experience.
