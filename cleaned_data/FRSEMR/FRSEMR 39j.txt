This course is a really great way to think deeply about the relationship between humans and their various environments throughout U.S. history. I would recommend taking this course if you like history and would like to attempt to study it through an environmental lens.
It's a very interesting class, but make sure to understand it is history based (not science like I thought it would be...) Be ready to read every week and to speak up in class (which is not a bad thing, it's actually quite fun)
It is an engaging and interesting seminar.
Nothing that hasn't been published.
This class is great for what it is - a seminar class that is graded sat/unsat - and you will take out perhaps more than you put in. If you have a general idea what you are talking about in class, you will find the discussions really thought provoking. Susanna does a marvelous job of facilitating discussions and helping unearth what you think about important issues discussed. She is definitely a left-leaning (politically) teacher, so if that bothers you be forewarned. It's possible not to lean that way and learn wonderful things though (my case)! :) She is wonderfully passionate about what she believes in!
It focuses on the historical view of environment.
It'd be much easier/less burdensome for you to read the materials over a couple days, but Susanna is still awesome no matter what.
Get ready, the class is great and the fieldtrip is fun!
