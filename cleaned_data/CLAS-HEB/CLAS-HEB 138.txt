The subject matter requires concentration because it is complicated.
The second half DOES deal with the Bible.
I would recommend this class to other students interested Semitic philology. And I think Jennie did a good job teaching the class. However, the historical grammar of Hebrew is, I think, a bit theoretical and, perhaps, a bit speculative at times. So I would hesitate in recommending this class to students who are not terribly interested in this very specific discipline.
This is an advanced course. If you haven't studied other semitic languages besides Hebrew or are unfamiliar with linguistics you will have a tough time.
I think this is a really important class for anyone planning to work in biblical studies to take, and probably of interest for those within historical linguistics in general.
