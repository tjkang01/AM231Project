the instructor, Justin Fifield, commands great skill at both Pali and Sanskrit language and literature and is a very effective language teacher.
A wonderful opportunity to study Pali in a relaxed and fun way. Justin is easy-going but pushes students well. A much more satisfying and coherent learning experience if you already know some Sanskrit, but not impossible if you don't.
