This was my favorite course of the semester.  Jonathan is not only a wonderful professor but also a great friend to his students and he really works with the class to tailor the assignments to focus on their interests.  The literature covered in the class is challenging but very rewarding in terms of parsing apart the grammatical structures.  The only downside to this course is that third year Tamil is only one semester long!
This class will be tailored to your needs. I certainly learnt a lot about my research area just by engaging with the readings. You won't regret it!
Jonathan is an exceptionally kind, supportive mentor, and the breadth of his knowledge in Tamil is remarkable. He is always eager and prepared to support students' research/language learning interests in any direction.
This is my second time taking this course and I was so happy that I did! A great way to keep up with Tamil.
I would absolutely recommend Tamil language study to any student at Harvard. You learn a fascinating and difficult langauge, but the instructor makes it fun and enjoyable. I only wish more people took this class!
Jonathan is awesome and this course is a really chill way to get a lot better at Tamil and read things you want to read.
