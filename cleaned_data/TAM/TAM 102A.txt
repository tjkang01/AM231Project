This class was an incredible experience. Jonathan is an incredibly nurturing individual, and he goes out of his way to make sure everyone is getting the most out of class. He even changed the lecture time to accommodate everyone who wanted to take it. I learned so much from this class, and would recommend it to everyone who thinks they have the background. It certainly wasn't an easy class, but with hard work it's possible to succeed.
Take it! It's fun and awesome and you'll be amazed at how much you learn!
If you are hesitating about taking this class, get rid of any second thoughts you may have and just take it! (the same thing applies to any class Jonathan teaches.
This was my absolute favorite class this semester.  If you have already taken 101 and are thinking about whether to take this course, it is highly worth your while.  Your command over the language will definitely grow, and all of the assignments were most enjoyable.  Jonathan is wonderful!
I'm enrolling in another semester for a reason.
