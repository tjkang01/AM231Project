You must have an adequate knowledge of ancient religion and civilizations to get the full benefit of this course.
I would make sure to express to students that Prof. Russell demands much of his students. His focus is also quite often more language based (i.e. comparative linguistics), and one must have an interest or basic background in Armenian studies.
Class was well organized, teacher was highly accessible, and well prepared.
Wonderful class on an incredibly interesting topic.  The small class size and enormous amount of interaction with the professor can't be beat.
