I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in Greek religion! The readings average between 50 and 70 pages a week and are all very interesting. You get to cover interesting topics like oracles, divine power, sacrifice, festivals, and more! With class presentations, you can select what topic you would like to cover and Professor Henrichs welcomed new ideas for discussion. Definitely take this course if they offer it again!
The class is a good and easy course, with interesting information.  There is a weekly presentation for 5 min and it is easy to prepare for.  Professor Henrichs will interrupt the presentations, adding more information, which is both helpful, but sometimes bothersome.
