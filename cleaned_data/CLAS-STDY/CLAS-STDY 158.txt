This course is superb.  Make sure you stay on top of readings and budget enough time for your final paper.
Very good, classic seminar style course. There aren't many of those at Harvard. It's a great experience and make sure you're keeping up. Prepare to be engaged
Do not pass up the opportunity to take a small, open course like this one with Professor Kosmin. If you have already taken 97a, you know that you're in for a spectacular course.
Excellent teacher. The discussion can get quite abstract and often deals with the nature of historiagraphy.
You should definitely be interested in the Hellenistic world if you consider taking this class. A lot of the reading are very classics-heavy, so a background in the classics is very helpful if you take this course. Professor Kosmin is great about meeting with students and is extremely knowledgeable about the subject, so don't hesitate to approach him! Be prepared to know a great deal more about Hellenistic history in this cousre than you expected, as the course is very detailed and interesting.
Join Dr. Kosmin and several highly qualified classmates for an engaging discussion of Hellenistic Empires, where the Greek culture you love meets the ancient civilizations you didn't know existed!
