This is a fantastic course into a little explored subject area. Looking at literary production from the late antique and medieval period is a fascinating excercise. You will read texts from a multitude of genre, produced in very different regions and contexts. Professor Leonte gives historical background, so you will understand Byzantium a lot better by the end of the course too.
