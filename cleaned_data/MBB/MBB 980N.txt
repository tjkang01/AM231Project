Take this class if you have interest in art and science and the interaction between them. There is so much to learn. It's an opportunity for exploration and discussion on a growing field of study.
Professor Etcoff is the sweetest. She has so much passion for the subject matter and is great at both facilitating discussion and letting the students takeover.
The entire class is discussion based, so if you are not a person who likes to participate, this may not be the class for you. But if you enjoy think-tank style or seminar style classes then you'll enjoy it. Also, be prepared to spend time doing the readings since it is extremely difficult to participate if you have not.
Super cool class with an amazing professor and peers from schools across Harvard (ed school, design school, college, etc.). Very discussion based. If you have any interest in exploring the arts from a different perspective, I would recommend this class.
Absolutely love the course and professor. Would definitely recommend it.
