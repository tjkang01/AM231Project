A great seminar that goes in depth into some really interesting questions - all three professors are really knowledgeable and really passionate about the topic, and it's great even just hearing them go back and forth
This is a really good seminar with very engaging faculty members, and if you are interested in the field of mind/brain/behavior, it is a really great space to discuss both cutting-edge research in the brain and also how such research fits into more long-standing philosophical questions on how the brain gives us a coherent representation of the world. What's fun about it is that you get to hear from and discuss with faculty who are personally working on these questions, and I think it is really thought provoking. It also strikes a good balance of science, psychology and philosophy, which I think is hard to do in a class. I would definitely recommend it!
