This is a great course if you want to know more about the process of how scholars turn ideas into books.
- great opportunity to see how scholars formulate their projects, but not a good way to get an overview of the field.
A great chance to talk with fellow Am Civ students, meet and talk with some affiliated faculty, and get exposed to a wide variety of academic works and critical approaches.
American Studies is the bomb!
This was the most challenging and rewarding course I have ever taken. From the Professor's command of the material and the high quality of student discussion to the field trips to Concord and archival field reports, the course was at all times memorable and edifying.
Great course to think about methodology, especially from an interdisciplinary perspective.
Try to start reading prior to the beginning of the semester.
Make it useful for you.
The greatest benefit to this course is the opportunity to meet and speak with successful scholars in the American Studies field.
This is a wonderful class, particularly for Americanist PhD students in the History Department, as it offers an introduction to a wide range of disciplinary methods that is not discussed in the History Department. This course also is a great opportunity to meet students concentrating on American History outside of the history department.
great introductory course on american history.
For incoming Am Civ students, this class is a must! It covers a wide range of methods and topics in American Studies. And the conversations you have with the authors of the books you read can be incredibly helpful and encouraging as they tend to share their own experiences of grad school and give advice on dissertation work.
