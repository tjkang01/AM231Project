You will get out of this course what you put into it.  You will get a lot of support, but you have to know what you want to work on.
I recommend it, but only to those who have prior experience/coursework on Homer; this is not an introductory seminar.
Take it! It will stimulate your research.
This class is a treasure grove of things about Homer that you never knew exist. It can make you change the way you thought about Homer in the most unexpected way. Whatever your research interests are, you can find something for yourself in this course. But you should be prepared to fill in the gaps in your education on your own since otherwise some of the things discussed in the class will just fly over your head.
