Come to this class if you have pre-existing ideas about Latin literature, which you want to discuss and develop with a wide variety of people working in different ways. This class is an opportunity to develop one's own research interests, and learn about those of others.
Prof. Thomas is outstandingly knowledgeable, yet extremely welcoming of non-specialists and open to different perspectives. He establishes a common ground for discussion and improvement without sacrificing complexity. He is an excellent discussion leader, able to mediate within a very heterogenous group.
