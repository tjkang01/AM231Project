Prof. Tarrant is truly amazing. Textual criticism is intimidating to people outside the field of classical philology, but it was made so approachable and inspiring by Prof. Tarrant.
This class was invaluable for learning how to use (and construct!) Latin textual apparatuses. It helped me see how important they are, and gave me to tools to understand how to work with them.
