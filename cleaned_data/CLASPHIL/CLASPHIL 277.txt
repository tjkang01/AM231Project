This course fulfills its advertised function admirably but, with the exception of the presentation and the final paper, does not really allow independent and in-depth engagement with the material on the student's part to the same degree as other graduate seminars might. I got a sense that it was often difficult in class for the students to bring their own previous expertise and reading to bear on the material under discussion.
It's an excellent way to acquire a set of skills relating to the constitution of our Latin texts, to engage with areas of scholarship that seem to have been increasingly overlooked, and to consider the theoretical problems involved in the very idea of constituting a definitive text of an author.
