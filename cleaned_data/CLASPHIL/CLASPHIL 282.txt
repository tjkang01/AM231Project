This course provides a useful introduction to Lucretian scholarship insofar as it touches on many different approaches to this author and his work. The course is useful not only as a way to read a lot of Lucretius and Lucretian scholarship but also as an case study in many different sub-fields within the Classics: textual criticism, literary criticism, papyrological studies, ancient philosophy, etc.
