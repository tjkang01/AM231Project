Proceed carefully and slowly with the material, as the subject does not reward racing through the material.
After taking this course you are more or less justified in calling yourself an "epigrapher"; this course provides all the tools necessary to situate yourself in the field and exposes you to all the most important types of inscribed text in the Roman world.
The material covered was very interesting and potentially useful, in so far as it gives a solid background in one of the major sub-disciplines of classics. I would only question the usefulness of a very large load of secondary-reading.
