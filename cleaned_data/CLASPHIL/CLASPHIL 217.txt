Wonderful class and wonderful teacher.
Whether you have access to the Greek, the Arabic or to both, I highly recommend this course for those interest in Greek and Arabic philosophy.
This class is a really interesting combination of things that provides a rare opportunity to engage with a philosophical tradition that weaves among disciplines. While quite high-level, this class has a tremendous amount to offer to people of various interests/talents.
