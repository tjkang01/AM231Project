Interesting readings, useful class.
Unique approach to rarely read material with two brilliant, knowledgeable professors
This course depends so much on in-class discussion that the quality of the course will necessarily depend on the quality of the people taking it.
This class will not appeal to every student, but if travel narratives are your cup of tea, it is a nice way to become introduced to the genre.
This was a new class, and it has a great deal of potential, but I think it's still a work in progress.  Reading entire works is really essential, but that doesn't leave much time to read anything else, including critiques of the works.  I think that it's really important that more emphasis is placed on discussing how to effectively use travel narratives as primary sources.
