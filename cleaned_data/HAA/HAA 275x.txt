This course demands close reading of very complicated texts. It is important to be able to see the readings from a variety of different historical and methodological perspectives. I highly recommend the seminar to anyone who is interested in gaining an understanding of German aesthetic theory of the first half century. But more importantly, it will instill a type of critical reading and questioning that will carry over to all future study.
