Great opportunity to look at the early modern period as a interconnected whole, broad appeal in both material and approach for students of any field in the humanities
fascinating topic- readings are quite dense though and the research paper is a challenge.
It is not a lot of work until the end. Work on your final paper early and do your presentation on the earlier side.
