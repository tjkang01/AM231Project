This is a very interesting class where you will have the opportunity to do groundbreaking work.
The course was a rare and priceless experience; couldn't have asked for a better one that combined a small class environment with rigorous research on an unfamiliar topic of interest.
Professor Levine is awesome. The topic is just so under researched that it is difficult with readings and such. The paper will more than likely be a novel paper.
