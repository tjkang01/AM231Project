Best art history seminar I've taken, period.
A great chance to learn about Post-War European art with one of the field's authorities (although it is a very particular version of Post-War art)
I would certainly recommend this course to students who have the proper background in the subject matter. The course is challenging and will give the student an opportunity to look deeply into key issues and questions related to art of this period. It is also an excellent opportunity to work with Prof. Buchloh, whose thinking has been formative in shaping the critical literature on art of this period.
