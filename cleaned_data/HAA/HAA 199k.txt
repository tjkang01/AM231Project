This is a good course for students looking to learn the basic in architectural methodology.
I think that this course is interesting if you have taken courses on architecture before and have been introduced to some of the topics, even if briefly, before the class.
Don't take it if you want to focus on architecture itself. Stuff about architecture is approached only obliquely--this class is all about scholarship, which can often feel quite disconnected from architects and buildings.
The class is best enjoyed if the student has a substantial background in architecture history.
This was a stressful course- I never knew what was expected from me, the discussions were too theoretical, the readings were very difficult to comprehend, and Professor Payne and Professor Levine often got engaged in some discussion without realizing some students(such as myself) had absolutely no idea what they were talking about! The material that I was able to understand was interesting, but only take this course if you are really quite passionate about architectural methodology.
The course could benefit from a bit more structure and clearer statement of purpose/method.
