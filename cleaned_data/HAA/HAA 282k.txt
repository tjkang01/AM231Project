Esoteric Buddhist Art in medieval India might sound like an obscure area but this is a very important foundation if you're interested at all in Buddhist/Indian art.  Professor Kim is not just amazingly erudite but brings the material to life.  She is also approachable, resourceful, and extremely supportive of her students.
If you are at all interested in engaging with an admittedly difficult set of materials, I can't think of a better way than this class.
