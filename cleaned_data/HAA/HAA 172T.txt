This class is extremely challenging, and the language and toolset it requires may be arcane to people who are not experts in photographic history. The class is more of a philosophy of history class than a typical HAA survey. Buchloh is a genius, but this class is not for the weak-hearted!
Taking this class, it was hard to conceptualize the flow/thread of photography. It was more a study of various historical clumps. But the workload is manageable and Professor Buchloh is brilliant. The problem is that he doesn't realize he's that smart, which means the class often flew above my head. Assignment wise, there's one class presentation and a final paper (no prompt). But I can't really say I can talk about photography better than I did before the class. Not sure I would redo it.
(Depending on your experience with art history) an at times hard to follow course. It is, however, incredibly rewarding when you realize your certain development of interest and knowledge in the history of photography with one of the most respected professors in art history (for good reason).
You definitely need to do the readings, or else you will get nothing out of this class (not to mention, Prof. Buchloh will know and be disappointed in youI can't think of anything worse). Don't be afraid to speak up in class, because Prof. Buchloh will really take the time to consider what you've said. This is a priceless opportunity; don't let it pass you by!
More preparation, more gain.
incredible opportunity to enjoy a master class in teaching art history by Professor Buchloh
This course is absolutely fascinating and stylized in a manner in which I expected most Harvard courses to be conducted. Professor Buchloh is a true expert and pops up in most of our readings, and his willingness to engage with individual student ideas and foster those thoughts, both in class and in office hours, is rare and genuine. It was truly a pleasurable class through and through.
