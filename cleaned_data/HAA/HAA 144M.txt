This is a very good seminar for people interested in learning more about Byzantine and medieval art history.  Professor Kalavrezou makes the class very interesting and fun, and it is great to get to know her.
It's a very specific class: it only covers one building. I would say that it's an interesting class even if you're not into Byzantine art because.
The two hour seminar format is tough for a class that is primarily looking a slides/lecture with less discussion, generally.
