I think that every HAA student should take a class with Prof. Cummins. In my four years at Harvard, he is one of the most delightful lecturers I have ever come across. He so clearly loves the material he studies, and even if (like me) you have zero background in it, he makes you love it too. If I could describe him in one word it would be raconteur. Each lecture is like a story unfolding. He also emphasizes that students get something out of the class and come away passionate, rather than emphasizing busy work or grades. The atmosphere was so relaxed and conversational. Really just such a delight and privilege to hear Prof. Cummins speak twice a week. Not to mention that the material was fascinatingI came away really with a new perception of the history of our interconnected world, familiar with material that I had never seen before. There was excitement with every week because I got the sense that this material was something that art history had neglected for so longthe field was wide open.
If you are interested in taking a class that is exploration where you are thinking on your feet, this is a great class. You won't learn the things you learn in this class anywhere else. Take this class to explore relatively new of research in Art History and to understand relationships between art traditions around the world through the trade of Spanish and Dutch Colonialism.
