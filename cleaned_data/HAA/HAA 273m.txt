The class focuses on Matisse's cut-outs, but by way of this central topic touches on a number of other issues central to modern European art. It can be taken by someone without prior study of Matisse. That said, you should be ready to learn a lot about Matisse and should have an interest in him.
Professor Gough is a gem professor. She is incredibly charismatic, intelligent, and more importantly, she cares deeply about her students. I was lucky to take this class with her. Learning about Matisse with her was truly once in a lifetime experience--it's obvious that she is passionate about Matisse, and it really comes through in the discussions. She did an amazing job guiding us through conversations, holding workshops, and setting up excursions. She also focuses a lot on how to write a good paper, which is one of the most important things about the concentration.
Very challenging, but equally rewarding.  A wonderful experience if one work's hard throughout semester.
