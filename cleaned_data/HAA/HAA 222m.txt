Fascinating subject matter about Mediterranean architecture for specialists as well as those with a more general interest. Sadly the class is limited in its use by an unadventurous pedagogical style and almost complete lack of class discussion. The paper topic, the only form of assessment, is a pleasure to research.
It is a class more focused on Islamic are than I imagined. The readings are fine, just be weary that a 20 page final sneaks up on you fast.
This class focuses on the Mediterranean as the facilitator of cross cultural communication and exchange.  At the same time, differences and local trends are also not glossed over.  It is great for students in a number of different art historical subfields because of its wide-ranging nature, both thematically and geographically.  But be aware that there is much less discussion that in a typical graduate seminar.  However, the fact that the last few weeks of the class are without assigned readings and let's you entirely focus on your paper and presentation is really helpful, both in how it does let you focus better on your own research, but also in giving a bit of breathing room during what is always a busy time.
It is recommended to have a background on history and/or fine arts in order to understand what your are required to do for this course, and to have less difficulties.
Take it! Wonderful lectures and an opportunity to read excellent material and prepare an extensive essay of one's choice with a great deal of superb guidance from both professors.
I would tell them that an opportunity to study with both of these scholars is one that should be taken advantage of. I found the seminar to be the best of my semester.
