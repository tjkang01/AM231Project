I would say that the show is a great introduction to Baroque architecture and gives a good survey of what can be considered Baroque.
Very interesting topic, great professor with very good lectures, but you need to have a bit of a background in architecture and know architectural terms or you will be a bit lost.
Broad, sweeping tour of Baroque monuments. Not very theoretically engaging.
Prof. Connors is a pleasure to listen to and it is incredible how much you learn at the end of it.
