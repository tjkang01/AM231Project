Prof. Bielfeldt is a delight to be with. She has an incredible knowledge of the period, and you will come out with a much stronger understanding of ancient art/archeology. Reading knowledge of German and Greek is certainly not necessary, but an asset. Be prepared to review/learn Greek mythology if you want to seriously grasp the material.
This course was wonderful! The structure of the class was a perfect balance between class discussion and lectures. The student contributions--presentations and reading responses--also facilitated great conversation and discussion.
This is a good course, but I would not recommend it as your first seminar, and definitely not as your first art history course, because the class jumps into the material without much preparation. If you don't know much about Hellenistic art, you may need to do some background reading. The material is often rather theoretical, and the readings rather dry, but I found the course overall enjoyable and a good experience. Professor Bielfeldt is the highlight of the class: she is an excellent lecturer and brings out the best of students' discussions. She's really adept at understanding what point you're trying to make even when you don't say it as clearly as you wanted. My only major complaint was that I couldn't meet with Professor Bielfeldt very often because I had a class during her office hours, but she did try to accommodate me.
very comprehensive and enlightening. challenges traditional viewership.
