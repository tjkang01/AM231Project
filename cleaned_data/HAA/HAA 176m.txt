The two profs are among the leaders in their respective fields, and bringing them together into a comparative class is an excellent way to engage with the material.
If you're interested in either location during the time covered it is an incredibly important course for cross-cultural contextuality.  Great readings.
Get ready for something really intense.
There is a ton of reading and discussions happen at a very high level, but it is an interesting course.
It's tough (there is a lot of reading and the discussion is very sophisticated) but it's a really good class. It's a unique way to approach the material and very productive to put the Russian and German avant garde side by side. The 1/3 undergrad 2/3 grad breakdown can occasionally be frustrating because it's difficult to get basic questions answered/clarified and you are basically at the mercy of what the graduate students want to talk about.
Really fabulous class, great discussion
