The research is entirely under your control, so take advantage of all the resources and Professor Levine's guidance to explore!
HAA 176n was an outstanding seminar! The course started out with truly fascinating readings and lectures not just by the amazing Neil Levine but also experts and art historian from both around the world and Harvard. With such a small class, I really felt like I learned so much from everyone! HAA176n was a really great educational experience for me!
I would only recommend this course to students who want to learn about Baghdad, specifically, even if they wanted to use it in a comparative perspective with other cities.
