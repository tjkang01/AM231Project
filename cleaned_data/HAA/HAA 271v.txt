Although I cannot say that I had the best of experiences in this coursedue to my own shortcomings, I can, without any doubt, say that this course has proved to be my most intellectually-stimulating endeavor at Harvard. Professor Buchloh is rightfully a legend and a legendary teacher, who excels in the art of asking the right questions, and he will push you to your very limits. Do keep in mind that, especially if you're an undergrad, this course requires at least twiceor maybe even three timesthe usual input for a course. People always say that this or that course has changed their lives, but Marcel Duchamp: Seminar WILL provide you with an impeccable framework and a unique perspective to look at modern (post1910) and contemporary art.
The absolute thrill of engaging Buchloh on the subject is worth taking the course alone. This semester, however, was extremely chaotic and poorly planned.
