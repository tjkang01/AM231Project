Best seminar I have ever taken.
The level of the discussion, clarity and originality of the debates, and exciting selection of works, theoretical texts and discussion topics all contribute to make it one of the best classes I have ever taken.
It is best to take this course if it is really a point of interest for you, and if you have a background in theoretical work. If not, the discussions can seem daunting, and students who do not contribute, or feel intimidated, can add a lot of tension to an already-rigorous class.
