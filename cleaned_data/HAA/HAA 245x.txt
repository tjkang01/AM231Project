Such a unique opportunity, and the chance to learn from a wonderful professor in an unparalleled context.
A great introduction to early northern Renaissance art!
This is a great course for anyone, regardless of specialty.  The studied works themselves are worth taking this course, and Professor van der Velden's unique approach is very informative for those who are specifically considering various methodologies of art history.
Having the opportunity to look at works of art in person with Professor van der Velden was without a doubt one of the highlights of my academic experience at Harvard and gave me a whole new appreciation for connoisseurship.
