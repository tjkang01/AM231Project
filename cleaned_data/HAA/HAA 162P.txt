The final paper is fairly long (although not at all uncommon for the department at 12-15 pages for undergraduates). I haven't written many papers of that length, but the amazingly open topic and Professor Pereda's awesome support (helping everyone find papers and books that related to their specific topic off the top of his head--his knowledge is truly encyclopedic), made it totally doable. Just be sure to pace so that you can produce the kind of work that this excellent course merits and encourages!Honestly one of my favorite courses at Harvard.
only take if you are passionate about this material, it isn't catered to casual or beginner level knowledge
