You will get to meet many amazing professors, some of them you will aspire to be like in the future.
As I mentioned above, the course is rather awkwardly positioned as a requirement and as a course.  An overhaul will be beneficial.  The professor's are all very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about what they present, and are very open to questions.
It was worthwhile to see the objects and I enjoyed the material discussions and hands-on activity that was a component of this class.
see other comment on time slots. obviously, not something that can be "recommended" as it is a requirement
Very enjoyable course and a nice introduction to instructors in the department.
A unique opportunity to get to know objects in the Harvard Art Museums collection and to see them through the eyes of HAA faculty.
