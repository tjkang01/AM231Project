Writing a thesis can be extremely rewarding if you put time, thought, and effort into it :) Within the HAA department, there are ample resources and people who want to help you, which makes the thesis writing process less difficult!
Students must be aware of the rigor of this process. It is also very helpful to establish how often they will meet with their advisors and the goals for these meetings early on to have greater accountability and an overall plan for the completion of the thesis.
Only write a thesis if you are doing it for yourself. It is a painful process but incredibly rewarding. Being organized is half the battle. Find an adviser who is compatible with you not only due to subject matter but to work habits. There is no shame in quitting. Best of luck.
