Ensure you have some familiarity with older figures in art history (Panofsky, Warburg, Riegl, etc).
You will enhance your prior knowledge on the methods.
Make the most of the opportunity to speak with many members of the department!
Any student who intend to pursue a professional career in art history should take the course.
Be sure to do your readings closely and start assignments in a timely fashion.
The class will be interesting, the readings themselves will often be frustrating.  But it is important to be familiar with these topics, and it is important to start to think about how you want to approach your own research.
Very thought-provoking reading and paper responses allowed me to explore new ideas and methods. Lots of reading, but very much a worthwhile course.
