Connors is a great professor with great knowledge about the subject matter. His lectures are great, because he is genuinely enthusiastic. However, he does not give much feedback, and you are often confused about how you are doing in class.
Professor Connors is amazing, the class is very enjoyable and not a lot off work, I recommend it highly.
Connors is an expert in the field and makes going to class interesting and engaging. Enjoyable to listen to, and the topic is so fascinating that the 2 hour class period goes by pretty quickly.
It is not a very hard class but it is very interesting and Connor's is a great professor not to mention an awesome guy.
