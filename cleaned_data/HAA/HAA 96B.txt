This is the best class I've ever taken in my entire academic life!
Taking this course was an amazing experience. It was a lot of work, and it wasn't easy, but the kind of thinking we did was very different from the kind of thinking you usually do at Harvard. It offers a great opportunity to learn, but also to let yourself be creative. I highly recommend the class. I'd take it again in a heartbeat.
For those who enjoyed Transformations, definitely consider building on your design skills in this class!
