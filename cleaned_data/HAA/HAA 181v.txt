Professor Little is an admirable instructor and worth experiencing. His approach to Daoism is accurate and relevant in many ways, especially to those interested in East Asian pre-modern studies.  I highly recommend this course.
Great to have a chance to study an unusual subject matter such as this.
The lectures tend to ramble and are sometimes repetitive; the reading choices are good but not well-integrated into the course; structural changes (shorter lectures and added discussion time) would probably make the course more enjoyable.
This class has really interesting material and a low workload. If you are willing to put in a lot of effort for the final paper, I completely recommend this class.
The museum tour component of the class is a rare opportunity for students to get familiar with real works and closely examine them. On-site learning is much more effective than lectures in classrooms for art history students.
Stephen Little is a very knowledgeable and passionate expert on this topic. Be prepared to work hard for the final paper and make sure you don't start too late. The rest of the course is not stressful at all though and you learn a lot.
