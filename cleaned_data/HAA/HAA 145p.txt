Professor Hamburger is an amazing professor who makes each lecture interesting and engaging.  Even if you have no prior interest in medieval art history, Professor Hamburger will make it interesting, while providing you with an appreciation and knowledge of not only the time period but the individuals and objects within the medieval period.  His knowledge about medieval manuscripts is unparalleled and having the opportunity to hear him lecture about a manuscript while looking at the real thing is a learning experience that you cannot get anywhere else.
Professor Hamburger is a very knowledgeable and engaging lecturer, and will bring out some of the most interesting themes of the subject
I really loved this class.  The material itself is just fascinating.  Professor Hamburger is an engaging lecturer, and he balances lecturing with discussion.  If anything, we didn't have enough time to discuss things, and the class leaves you wanting to see more.  It also provides the opportunity to work with Harvard's incredible collection of facsimiles and manuscripts.
This class is pretty interesting and covers art you probably don't even know exists. Harvard has an amazing collection of facsimiles and it's really cool to get to see them. Hamburger definitely knows what he's talking about. I'd say that the more interested in medieval art and christianity the better for this class because if you aren't that interested, the class can be a bit dull.
