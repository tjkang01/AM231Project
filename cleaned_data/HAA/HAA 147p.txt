The trip is awesome, Ioli is wonderful, but you will have absolutely no idea what grade you are going to get. No assignments/ feedback except for your final grade. On the plus side, only one paper though.
Professor Kalavrezou is a generous, encouraging faculty member who takes great interest in her students' development. She created an environment in which students could feel comfortable participating at any level, and made early Christianity more accessible through helpful stories, analogies to modern day, humor, and constructive discussion.
Professor Kalavrezou is the best.  She is so sweet, knowledgeable, and funny.  This class was laidback but super interesting and I learned a lot.  Professor Kalavrezou took us on a trip to Washington, D.C. which was incredible.  Can't recommend this class enough.
