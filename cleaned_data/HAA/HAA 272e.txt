The reading list for this course is superb, if rigorous. Given the seminar set up, it is absolutely imperative one reads everything and considers it critically before going into class. Demanding as it is, this course was one of the most rewarding I have taken in the HAA department. The true strength is the discussion, affording one the chance to hear how Professor Lajer-Burcharth and one's peers perceive each week's material. Every meeting was incredibly interesting, informative and thought-provoking. I so appreciated the challenge this course presented and would highly recommend it.
TAKE THIS COURSE ITS AMAZING
It's a great opportunity to challenge one's thinking about painting.
This is absolutely the most difficult course I have taken at Harvard; the readings are long and dense, and the discussions are demanding. But it was definitely worth it. Working with Professor Lajer-Burcharth was an honor and a privilege.
This class was a wonderful opportunity not only to see a larger picture of painting, but also to spend time with passionate students and a professor who knew so much and said it so clearly and concisely.  The trips we took were also wonderful experiences.
