You would not regret taking this course.
This is a great course and a wonderful case study of the ancient world. The class did a great job navigating the polyvalence of Roman sarcophagi and introducing students to the openness of these archaeological and art historical pieces. Be prepared to acknowledge the complexity of these sarcophagi and stretch your understanding of them.
You learn a lot about a topic you may have not thought important, but as the course progresses you learn just how applicable its material is to your life.
Excellent course with a great professor.
This is a truly rewarding course, I am really glad that I took this course. Knowledge wise, after the course, I was able to identify most Roman mythological sarcophagi I encountered before. Method wise, it enables a way of studying art history that can be very logical, with reasoning, and more importantly without loosing originality and innovation. Prof. Bielfeldt's teaching is very convincing and rigorous.
You really need German for the research.
