This class isn't very structured and you receive almost no feedback on your work (weekly response papers) until you realize that the professor favors certain students. The material is very interesting but because the class is so unstructured, a lot of the content falls through the cracks or never gets covered. It's a chill class though!
This is a very nice art history class even for students who have not taken a course in the department before.  The writing and discussion that can be developed from analyzing and comparing twelve pieces of artwork from throughout China's history is very exciting.  The weekly case studies can make the class seem like a fun visual mystery to solve!
