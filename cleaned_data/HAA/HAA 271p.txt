I highly recommend working with Professor Payne, and it is a real pleasure to interact with her on material which she knows extremely well: the Renaissance architecture treatise. I would highly recommend reading her book on the architectural treatise, as if provides a good companion to the material covered in the seminar.
rare opportunity to access university collections
Nor is the history of architecture to be exclusively identified with buildings, but also with books, writings and drawings, capable of developing and communicating architectural ideas. If you love books, history and architecture, it is a very appropiate course.
A great small class with Alina as a great professor. It is a one in a million class by being able to go to Houghton and look at amazing books from the 15th and 16th centuries.
Prof. Payne provides a well-curated syllabus and engaging introduction to the topic, in addition to selecting an impressive variety of material to consult each week in Houghton.
I thought this was course was going to be about the Italian Renaissance.  It kind of is in the sense that we looked at a lot of Renaissance material.  That's all good but what the course is ACTUALLY about is the translation of architecture through different media. It's totally fascinating.
