This class is a challenging, but rewarding look at post-war American art, examined equally rigorously from both historical and theoretical perspectives.
I'd recommend that a future student approach the course with a relaxed yet actively curious attitude. I'd recommend that the future student very carefully read the materials assigned for each class and work to recognize the meta-critical arcs of the syllabus. I'd also suggest that the future student maintain a bit of distance from the transactions (pedagogical & intellectual) that propel the course forward.  Finally, I'd recommend that the student relish the opportunity to work through a fascinating set of developments in postwar art with one of the most commanding voices in that field.
