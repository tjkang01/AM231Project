Extremely interesting course.  Great reading/syllabus.
I would tell students that the class is quite demanding and intense but absolutely worth taking, especially for modernists (as well as, of course, people who study the 18th century), as the class explores the idea that the 18th century saw the emergence of what we now understand as modernity.
This course is an amazing sweeping theoretical/conceptual overview of the art of 18th century France, and is a must-take for ANY early modernist. Even if you have no understanding/knowledge of France in the 18th century, this course is very accommodating due its breadth and Prof. Lajer-Burcharth's provocative choice of readings. Having taken several courses with Prof. Lajer-Burcharth, I would say that this is her very best.
The course is very heavy on its emphasis.
Be ready to work - the Professor is not kidding. By the end of the semester you will have a solid foundation on the period/themes presented. This seminar is what exactly you would expect from a a history of art class on 18th century so if you have no interest at all think twice. However there is much flexibility on the discussions-papers. Honestly, I never thought 18th century would be so interesting!
It is a challenging theory course where students participate a great deal. The bar is high. If you want to become more knowledgable on art history methodologies, jump in. Students in this class learn from eachother as well as the professor. Class participation is a key driver.
