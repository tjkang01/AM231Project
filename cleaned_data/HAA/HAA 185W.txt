HAA 185W was a wonderful way to gain exposure to certain art histories that would not usually make their way into an introductory survey class.
Take this class if you are interested in learning about non-Western art. If the course is a bit better structured next year, you will gain a lot from it. There are really fun trips to nearby museums.
Professor Lippit and Professor Mattos are great lecturers, and the information is interesting, particularly given the western focus in HAA. The course has a low workload and is very manageable.
This was a great class if you're interested in the western idea of the Academy interpreted by non-western cultures.
