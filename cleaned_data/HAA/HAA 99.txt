Only do a thesis if you really love the subject!
Love Robin Kelsey and he will love you back.
if this course were to be offered as an option rather than a requirement, I would recommend that the student consider how they have worked on seminar papers in the past, whether or not they feel they have adequate support amongst other peers and professors, and ultimately to keep to the deadlines offered on major assignments, but to think carefully about morale!
The History of Art and Architecture department was so much more helpful to thesis writers than other departments (from speaking to friends I can say this)
This course was great as a support network and a method of getting the ball rolling on the whole thesis process. Don't skip class, you'll regret it!
