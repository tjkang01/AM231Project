If you are really into pre-Christian/early Christian Rome I'd definitely recommend this course. If not take a more comprehensive art history course.
This is a great class.  I highly recommend it.
If not for the subject matter, take this class for Ioli, she is a gem in the department, a true sage and an inspiration to study art history in a light hearted but still serious manner
I found the two hours a week spent in class to be a visual feast and a ever so temporary respite from the press of the modern. I thoroughly enjoyed the time spent in class reviewing visuals of the monuments and reading up on them at home.
This course has a very light workload and provides an excellent introduction to the most important monuments and objects of the early Byzantine era.
keep up with the work and you will love this class!
This is a great way to fulfill a pre-modern requirement if you are an art history modernist!
You will have many opportunities to look closely at visual material.  Prof. Kalavrezou is very helpful when you meet with her to discuss your paper topic.
You get out what you put in....in other words, do the readings and attend the classes and it will be a great class!
