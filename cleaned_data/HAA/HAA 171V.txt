You will read and listen a lot, but it is worth it simply for the structure of Professor Lieber's lectures and the depth with which you will explore contemporary architecture from 9/11 to even Sex in the City. With assignment's Professor Lieber will let you write and expound on those crazy ideas that other instructor's would call crazy, unrealistic, or unacademic. You will be able to have your own voice in your writing and truly create, rather than derive, your thesis.
Well this was a one time thing but if you have the chance to take Professor Lieber's courses, wherever they may be, you'll be in for a treat.  He's a powerful and engaging lecturer and he knows what he's talking about.  For the papers, he really encouraged us to explore our personal critiques and made them open so we could focus on whatever interested us.
Please don't take the course if you're interested in a strict architectural history survey. But if you're interested in unique approaches and unique connections to late 20th century architecture, you'll enjoy the course very much.
Fascinating account of how contemporary architecture got to where it is, and what are its pressing concerns.  Crosses the worlds of art, film, media, politics, economics, history to tell the story.
If you are interested in contemporary architecture, I recommend this class with no doubt.
As Professor Lieber will tell you himself in the first class meeting, this course is not meant to be a survey of contemporary architectural buildings, but rather an exploration of some of the more theoretical and philosophical considerations of contemporary architecture. If you understand this and are still interested, it is a phenomenal course.
