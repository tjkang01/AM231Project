Awesome class taught by a really nice professor. you get to learn amazing stuff if you are into anatomy, and you get to do a CT project which is really cool.
If you're really interested in bone and the general skeletal system this would be great. If you're not super enthusiastic about the topic, then it might get a little dry.
Definitely take this course! Meir is awesome and knows a lot about bones. The material (bone biomechanics, etc) isn't always super easy, but Meir doesn't expect you to be bone experts by the end of the class. It's really fair and the assignments are interesting and fun.
To my knowledge, this course will not be offered at Harvard in the future.
Meir is an awesome lecturer and the course material is very interesting. The way the class is structured allows you to take control of the assignments- it was a very fair syllabus and Meir stuck to it well.
Good easy course that only meets once a week. If you don't like bones then you will get very very bored
A good look into a anatomical field that doesn't get much publicity but is crucial nontheless
