Every human should take this course. It explains so many of the forces that shape our minds, bodies, and institutions, and leaves you thinking about life in a very different way.
The material in this class is fascinating, and the professors are brilliant and remarkable in their own ways. It was sometimes tough to follow the flow of the class over the different lecturers with their different approaches, but all the content was really interesting. However, three hour lectures with hardly any discussion are tough-- hopefully they'll not have it in the morning next time! In many ways, this class was almost more interesting from a social science perspective than HEB. Very good for people with interdisciplinary interest.
It taught me a lot about cultural evolution and integrated many different perspectives. I liked how interdisciplinary it was. Since I'm not an HEB concentrator it was just a total elective for me, and while it did make me think and expose me to awesome new ideas and great professors/researchers, I kind of regretted taking it because it was basically a 3 hour lecture at 9 am, which I am not cut out for and I think it prevented me from getting as much as possible from the class.
Be prepared to do a lot of reading on a weekly basis, much more than any other HEB course I've ever encountered. The three hour lectures are also somewhat difficult to sit through. Overall an interesting course but needs improvements after its first year.
An interesting way to gain a more interdisciplinary perspective on evolution and culture. Could be better organized
