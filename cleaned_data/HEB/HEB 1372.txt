Fun and not too hard. Jim's a very thoughtful professor, but that doesn't make him a hard-ass.
This is certainly one of the most enjoyable life sciences courses I have taken. It was the perfect mix of a relaxed atmosphere and a rigorous attention to scientific details. The class was at its best when we had discussions--which was about 2/3 of the time. Lectures sometimes did not generate the same degree of interest and excitement. Manageable workload, and the completely open-ended paper at the end was fun to do because we could cater it to our particular interests.
If you want an interesting, relaxed class, take this!
