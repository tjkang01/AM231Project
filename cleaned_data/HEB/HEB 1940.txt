This is by far my favorite course that I've taken here. True, it was the first time offered so they're still working out some kinks, but it can only go uphill from here. The professors are super fantastic and the case studies are really interesting. You get to go on field trips and meet experts, and then do a fabulous self-directed research project at the end. Lots of enthusiasm required!
Most interesting course I've taken thus far!
If you're a scientist, don't take this class. If you're a historian, don't take this class. But if you don't care for these labels and have broad interests in learning about historical phenomena using scientific techniques, then this class presents a set of case studies that I highly recommend. However, this class is highly dependent on the work that you put into it. If you really care, genuinely find the readings and topics interesting, and are passionate about your research project, it is a wonderful experience. However, because new topics are presented every week or two and the bulk of the work is in the research project, it is easy to become disengaged, especially because the professors put together some topics they found interesting, which is quite different from a lecture course.
This course is an amazing survey of scientific techniques and theoretical methods relating to the Science of the Human Past - and the field trips are great!
