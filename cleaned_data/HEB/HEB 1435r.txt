Fantastic learning experience; great introduction to independent research.
No other class I've taken here offers anywhere near the freedom or support to pursue a project of interest within the bounds of its curriculum. If you place great import on being able to get your hands dirty while learning science, this is an excellent class for you.
Take this class. If you have any interest whatsoever in primate evolution, anatomy, or fossils, then this class is a wonderful opportunity to explore those interests with a hands-on approach. Prof. Barry is amazing and will work one-on-one with you throughout the course, deepening your connection to the material. You really learn with your hands in this course, which is so refreshing in today's academic system!
