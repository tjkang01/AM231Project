This  is the most interesting class I have taken at Harvard. Everyone should take this class. Helped me think critically and also about how to approach problems like diet from new perspectives
It's a seminar, so you get as much as you put into it. It's probably possible to go to a class after having only skimmed a couple of the readings, but in order to really learn about the topics being discussed it's definitely more useful to put some time into the readings and form your thoughts before class. The term paper at the end of the semester was pretty hard, but considering that and the midterm paper are the only real assignments, it didn't feel like an unreasonable workload.
Amazing course and the knowledge you gain can benefit your wellbeing for life! Both professors are super enthusiastic about the subject and make the course fun and stress-free.
This is incredibly important knowledge, thus I would recommend anyone that has the background and is able to get a spot in the class to take it.
I can not recommend this class enough. One of the best (if not the best) upper-level HEB courses I've taken. Be prepared to read difficult literature and really tease them apart and think critically. Do not be intimidated by the graduate students!
I'd recommend this class to anyone who wants to explore in detail the evolutionary basis for modern-day health issues
One of my favorite classes of all time! Rachel and Dan are SUPERSTARS and so eager to share their knowledge. Discussion was always so stimulating, and I learned as much from my peers as I did from the readings themselves, which were also super interesting!
