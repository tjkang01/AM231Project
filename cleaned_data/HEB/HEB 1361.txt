Great chance to engage in high-level discussion of both hormones and life history theory. Provides a lot of great nuances that is often skimmed over in intro HEB courses. Highly recommend for anyone hoping to engage with questions in reproductive ecology more fully.
Professor Ellison and Professor Lipson were fantastic. They are definitely at the forefront of the field so take the opportunity to learn from them (especially Peter since he is likely to retire soon)! In terms of weekly course work it's super chill- not too much reading. Your grade is based on just two exams (no final), but they give you the questions ahead of time. It's not a difficult class and the material is really interesting for those looking for an advanced HEB course.
Professors are extremely knowledgeable about the subject matter of the course and beyond. They are the perfect petiole to learn this subject from, as they are so influential in the field. They encourage deep thinking about human evolution and physiology, and encourage thinking from a perspective new to many of us. this course is definitely worth the time, I never felt a moment was wasted. The exams are extremely fair with no trick questions or surprises. They are an honest test of your understanding of the main themes of the course. I really loved this course and recommend it highly.
Should you be interested in the subject material or evolution more broadly, the course will be incredibly useful.
