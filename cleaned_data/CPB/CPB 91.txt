Great way to begin/continue research.
Research for credit is a great way to free up time to work in lab. I would not have managed to work as many hours in lab per week as I did this semester without taking this course. It's especially helpful to take junior spring if you are planning to complete a thesis.
This is a great way to get a sense of what working in a lab is really like. It does take a lot of time but it is certainly worth it.
Spend some time outlining expectations for yourself, with the concentration advisors, and/or with your lab mentor. It will make the semester go much smoother.
Take this if you need a flexible 4th class and want to get more involved in your research!
This is a wonderful way to really commit to a lab without having it interfere with other classes.
This class is nice because it gives you the opportunity to conduct research as a class rather than just as an extracurricular. You'll be able to spend more time doing research than would otherwise be possible. You're experience will really depend on how your lab environment is -- if you like your lab and interested in the research, you'll have a great semester!
Marty is great. Period.
