Take it. It makes you look at the world and your body differently, and learn how to say things without words.
If you have any interest in pursuing choreography, even just during your college years, I would highly recommend taking this course.  Apart from being a fun opportunity to dance and do less stressful academic work, you will really learn things about your own dancing that will help you be both a better choreographer and a better dancer.  You study the components of choreography in depth and learn how to give nuance to your own style, so that choreography becomes not just a combination of steps but a complete idea and "painting" of movement on the stage.
its a wonderful chance to pay attention to how you move, to develop this attention, and also to practice performance.
This class is well worth your while. It could be an easy class, but if you put some effort into it, it will be far more rewarding.
This a fun class to take!
