Philosophy 242 is a fantastic class!  Professor Goldfarb is an incredible instructor, and I learned an enormous amount this semester.  The material was very interesting, and I really appreciated the opportunity to learn more about the history of logic using original source material.
Professor Goldfarb provides the optimal environment for learning the history of modern logic. The course was thorough and rigorous, but it was also fun, in large part due to his discussion of the weekly papers.
