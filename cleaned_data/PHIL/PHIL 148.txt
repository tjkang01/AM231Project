Lectures were horrible and slow. But section was really awesome. Make sure you go to section! It clarifies most of the points in lecture and makes you think carefully about the reading.
Don't bother taking it. The material is great, but the professor is not very engaging, and logistically, the class is a failure.
Do not take this class unless the professor appears to be on top of his game. No matter how interesting you find it, the material is way too difficult for you to do it essentially alone.
If you really like math and you really like philosophy totally take this course. If not then it might be painful. This was one of my favorite courses I took at Harvard. It turns out math is really hard to justify philosophically and to date no one has done a good enough job!
If you are interested in this subject, then this is a fantastic course. Goldfarb has great insight and explains things clearly, and presented a nuanced view of all the positions we discussed (essentially all the major historical positions in philosophy of math, so it was reasonably comprehensive). The readings are very thought-provoking, well-chosen, and of a reasonable weekly load. However, if you have some interest in the material but are more interested in having a seminar experience, this class is probably not for you; the nature of the course content is not very amenable to a seminar-style class (lots of technical matters which don't work well taught in a seminar format), esp. in this formulation. I learned a lot from the course, but, unlike its advertised nature, it was a lecture course.
Take this class; it will make you a better thinker. Prof. Goldfarb is an enthusiastic lecturer and he sprinkles in great anecdotes.
