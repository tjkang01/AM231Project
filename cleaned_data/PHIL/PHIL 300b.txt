I found the first-year colloquium to be a great introduction to graduate school. The professor was enthusiastic about the material, and the course's structure was both challenging and exciting.
The course is highly rewarding and you will get out of it what you put into it.
Well, it's mandatory, so I can't really recommend the class itself, but I would definitely communicate the good fortune of getting to take it with Professor Berker.
It is a very enjoyable course. Also you are required to take it, so what I say doesn't really matter.
Political philosophy may be hard and messy, but you need to go what's going on there!
Even if ethics is not one's main interest, there is a lot to be gained from the attention to detail Selim brings to discussion and the assignments.
Irrelevant. It's mandatory.
