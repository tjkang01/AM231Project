The topics were very interesting, issues that I hadn't really thought much about before. Seminar discussion overall was engaging and directed well, although some weeks were dull. I would have liked to have gotten more feedback, though.
Make sure you find the material engaging
Professor Shelby is wonderful and asks really interesting questions.  The family is a topic underexplored by philosophers and I'm really happy to have taken a class on it.
If you are looking for the rigor of a philosophy course and the practical relevance of a sociology or public policy seminar, this is the class for you. Professor Shelby is not only brilliant and a gifted discussion leader, but is also one of the only philosophy professors at Harvard doing work that has real impact on human lives. A clarification: this course doesn't ask, "How should we parent?" It asks questions like, "WHY do parents have obligations to their children?" I was super interested in the latter kind of question. If you are, too, then I highly recommend that you take this class.
The family is a neglected topic within philosophy, which made this class both refreshing and frustrating. It was intellectually rewarding to consider issues related to the family from the perspective of justice, though I could not help but be reminded of the limitations of the approaches we examined in adequately addressing many of the issues we looked at.
