Definitely a very good class if you want to engage philosophically with Augustine.
Prof. Doyle is super cool--he's very funny. He's also very knowledgeable. He's good at answering question and admitting when he doesn't know the exact answer to something which I really appreciated. The corse material is interesting, if not always philosophical.
If you want to connect philosophy with orthodox Christian thought, or just explore interesting questions in classical philosophy of mind, this class is a blast!
