Extremely helpful.
Approach the workshop as another one of the department's little hazing rituals. While Tim sleeps and Chris glares, you will feel like the whole world wants you to fail. Try not to let this get to you, and write down as much as you can of the questions people ask. It does often turn out to be useful. Also, try to find a separate, more congenial environment for sharing your own work where you can actually get some support and encouragement.
