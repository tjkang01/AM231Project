The readings are interesting, not too long. There are two short papers and one final one. You can get a lot of helpful feedback from Professor Moran (who is great!) and the in house philosophy writing tutor. Very fun class if you're at all interested in aesthetics.
If you're interested in approaching questions of beauty/art/value from a philosophical perspective, take it! Reading list is a keeper. Discussions are interesting. Professor Moran is really nice and well-informed.
