The only grade this year was a 15-20 page term paper, a very different format from most undergrad classes, something important to keep in mind. Overall, the workload during the semester was very low, but expect a few days of intense papering at the end.
This is a great course for anyone interested in thinking philosophically and systematically about questions that are closely related to the course of our everyday lives. The course takes up challenging questions such as "What role does happiness play in well-being?", "What is the relation between personal well-being and morality?" and "What does living a meaningful life involve?".
