Doyle is great, but much of three class was unfocused or poorly planned, much of this is likely due to this being the first year the course has been taught, and things will likely improve in future, yet during this paddy year these problems were significant.
Professor Doyle is a deep thinker, an engaging lecturer, and very knowledgeable about a wide range of philosophical material. I was hesitant to take the class when I saw how few people shopped it, but having only five undergrads in a philosophy course provided one of the most intellectually engaging experiences of my time at Harvard. This is one of the few courses I've found that actually talks about the human soul and the psyche in depth. Professor Doyle was a bit disorganized, but its his first semester here, and he compensated with phenomenal discussions inside of lecture and out, and incredibly thoughtful and lengthy feedback on my essays. I am so glad the phil department brought him on board.
DO NOT TAKE IT. There isn't a single concentration that requires you to take this, so don't.
James Doyle is an amazing guy with tons of knowledge and insight of the myraid of philosophical texts available. Listening to him speak about philosophy sounds so organic and he really makes the authors understandable. I really enjoyed the time spent in class and it has already enriched my life. This is the first class that has actually made me feel like I was getting a holistic education!
