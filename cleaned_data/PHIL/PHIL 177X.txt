Moral Theories is an incredibly important topic to think about and applicable to any discipline. Adam is a great lecturer, and seeks class participation without conditions of "proper phrasing" or "the answer I'm seeking for." He creates a really inclusive environment and gracefully balances the genuine importance of such a field with a levity that highlights a self-reflexive approach to making moral claims.
Take this class! Take this class if you're a philosopher and want a fresh take on moral theories and an incredible explanation. Take this class if you only want a little taste of philosophy as well because it is a great introduction to this branch and truly informative.
This was my favorite class of the semester. Even though we worked through many theoretical ideas, Professor Hosein was great at tying in thoughtful and understandable real-life examples. It's a truly accessible class, even for those who have no prior experience in philosophy. It was engaging and fruitful in terms of gained knowledge. Highly recommend.
