I definitely recommend this class.  Professor Rinard is brilliant and funny, and the material is interesting and likely completely new to you.  It is not a math course, and edges toward the metaphysical at the end.
Take it if the material interests you at all
Really cool@
As long as you are interested in philosophy and have a decent grasp of statistics, you will really like this course. The lectures are interesting and the work load is reasonable. Just don't expect to walk away with deeply satisfying answers. The course spends more time making you think through errors in certain philosophical ways of thinking, rather than developing its own worldview.
This class provides a nice introduction to formal epistemology. The first third of the class covers mathematical material, but its pretty straightforward. Overall the material is interesting and the lectures very clear and well-presented.
