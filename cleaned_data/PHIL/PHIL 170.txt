Bernard Williams is a challenging, complex, nuanced, fascinating thinker. Because he positions himself so clearly in opposition to many trends in the philosophical tradition, studying him felt (for me) like a breath of fresh air. Professor Bagley is an eclectic instructor with a keen ear for hearing students' thoughts and opinions and drawing out articulated strands to promote further, deeper dialogue.
It is a great introduction to the work of a terrific British moral philosopher! Teaches you about morality, rationality, blame, ancient vs modern philosophy, and more.
