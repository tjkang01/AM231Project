In my experience, the material, though of somewhat daunting reputation, was made very accessible in this course. Goldfarb is a gem.
you'll learn a lot of logic in goldfarb's very specific way of teaching it. the class is a small community and most of the students end up becoming quite close to one another; it's imprtant to pursue some sort of a study group. content is pretty interesting!
