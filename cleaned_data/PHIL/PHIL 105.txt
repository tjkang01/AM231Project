If you're interested in ancient philosophy, you can't not take this course, but if you're just looking to fulfill a dept. requirement, don't go out of your way for it.
Be sure to go to Professor Doyle for feedback on essay outlines.
Professor Doyle means well, but often bit off more than he can chew in lecture. The readings seemed distant at times from what was discussed in lecture. Make no mistake, the Stoic readings are interesting and a definite must-read, but I was disappointed by how little we could talk about the works specifically because Doyle would often talk about secondary literature or comparisons to historical context to a point that it could feel lost. If you have taken Ancient Philosophy, definitely take this course. Otherwise, just know 2-hours in a room on tangential material can be rough.
