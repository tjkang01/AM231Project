Great syllabus, good subject matter, and a refreshing balance to the Philosophy department's usual method of inquiry, which is very analytical.
This class can get boring even if you are obsessed with photography or philosophy. Aesthetics is a very insular field and a lot of the time you may find yourself asking "why? so what?" All the discussions seem futile and irrelevant to human experience. As an artist I found that what philosophy says about art is very unnecessary. If you have a thing for aesthetics, taking this class will make sure you don't make the same mistake again.
If you are looking for courses offered only at Harvard: this is it. Be prepared to be at awe how photographswhat seem so innocent and natural in our environmenthave so much at stake, both morally, aesthetically and philosophically.
Take this class! It's a fun class with a reasonable workload. It's a rare opportunity to actually have long discussions with a professor in a small setting. It was nice going to a chill class like this every week and although discussion can be dry sometimes, they're usually pretty decent. Don't put the readings until last minute! They're actually really interesting - I wish I had paid more attention.
