Do presentations! Unless there's a group of you working on roughly the same stuff, you won't be able to get the fine detail across in any case.
It creates a community where graduate students get to know each other's work.
When you get your first job in the boonies, you will *dream* about the incredible talent assembled in that room. So wake up and enjoy it.
Do not expect much feedback on the content of your work, since depending on the specialty of the faculty in charge you might or not get good feedback. But it is still useful course to hear about others' work. Also the fact that you need to present is a good motivation for writing a paper.
don't let it get to you.
