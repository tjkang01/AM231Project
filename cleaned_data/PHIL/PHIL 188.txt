This course was engaging, pure and simple.  It allowed for the confluence of detailed, analytical philosophy with discussions about art and expression, and upheld a rigorous standard by which students were to read Proust with a critical mindset.  It made me reflect deeply about my own life, and how I interact with the world and other people in it.  You should take this course.
I really enjoyed this course, even if it is a fair amount of reading each week.
Make sure you really enjoy reading Proust before you take the course. If you do love reading Proust, you will LOVE everything about this class--the readings, the lectures, the papers, section. If you don't, this class might be hard to get through.
the course has been personally intellectually important for me.
