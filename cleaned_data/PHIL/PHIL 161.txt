Have a background in philosophical thought.
The readings were dry and difficult, even as compared to readings in other philosophy classes. As an MBB seminar and a philosophy class, the class is composed of a mix of MBB students and philosophy concentrators, which is unusual and worth noting. If you're just taking it for philosophy, I'd recommend something else. If for the MBB seminar, I don't have much to judge it against.
I really enjoyed this course, and I think the subject matter is among the most exciting in Philosophy.  The material became very difficult by the end, and the papers (there were 3 throughout the semester) became accordingly daunting.  Professor Chen did do an excellent job of helping to organize the material and sort through some of the murkiness as things got more difficult, though.  She also put together really great handouts.
Chen is fantastic and the material is really cool
cheryl is so great. she's really sweet and really knowledgeable. she gives great feedback. just know going into the course that there's a certain familiarity with philosophy of mind (a particularly jargon heavy area of philosophy) assumed when you take this class. also know that it'll be a small class (they never fill these seminars) and you will have to talk. but if you're interested in this stuff (and it's fascinating stuff) you'll want to talk.
This class is interesting, engaging, and intellectually stimulating and is definitely strongly recommended to anyone concentrating in philosophy or interested in questions concerning personal identity.
Very interesting class with subject matter that is considered important to the individual and provides a high level of analytic discourse.
This is a course where you will be drawn into discussion about things that really excite you and you will loose track of time because the conversations are so engaging.
