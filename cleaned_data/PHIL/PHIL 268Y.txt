Selim and Derek are both extremely generous with their time. Selim is one of the most dedicated, capable lecturers I've ever met.
Although the course was a bit disorganized, the level of discussion was incredibly high and fascinating. Very fun to be a part of
Parfit and Berker are great, although Parfit can be a bit repetitive.
