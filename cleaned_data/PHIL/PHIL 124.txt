This was a great course and I would highly recommend it. Prof.S is a great professor and creates a very engaging class atmosphere. She is very knowledgeable and I found that she was able to explain tricky concepts very clearly. She is also very approachable and I felt comfortable going to her OHs to ask questions.
This was a great course. I learned much about metaphysics and got a lot of practice reading more difficult philosophy papers. This course helped me to fall in love with philosophy. I never felt intimated speaking up during class and loved how knowledgeable everyone was with the readings. You could tell that everyone cared about the course material. Essays were fun to write and the topics were interesting. The instructor was extremely helpful with writing the papers and was very easy to approach.
