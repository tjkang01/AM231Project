The opportunity to interact so closely with an accomplished professor who made himself extremely accessible was fantastic. This was my first (and only) philosophy class at Harvard, and while I certainly would have ended up with a better grade had I had more background, this was a great option. Professor Boyle knows what he's doing.
Great course, with and amazing lecturer. Due yourself the favor and take this course.
This is a fantastic course as long as you are interested in philosophy of mind.  It is very dense, and often dry, but can be incredibly stimulating if you find this field interesting.  Not for philosophy beginners.
This was the first real philosophy class I took at Harvard, and I enjoyed it thoroughly. The readings could be dense sometimes, but class was helpful for understanding the important points in the readings.
Definitely take it, just don't eat a heavy lunch before class, make sure to do all of the readings twice if you want to have any idea what's happening in class, and good luck with the papers! It is tough to formulate an original argument on these topics.
Interesting seminar on a pretty broad array of questions. Professor Boyle is a great, relaxed professor. A lot of the readings are stellar.
