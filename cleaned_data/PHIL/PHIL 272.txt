Extremely glad I decided to lottery for this course. It requires a lot in terms of depth and breadth of materials covered, and demandingness of final paper (particularly as the course is aimed at graduate students and I am an undergraduate with limited prior knowledge of political philosophy). But it has been a fantastic opportunity to engage with issues surrounding the concept of justice, and a truly unique insight into the opinions of Professor Sen on this topic. Eric Nelson was also fantastically good at summarising very difficult and profound arguments and his introductions to topics provided invaluable isights for someone who was coming to the topic of Justice from a purely philosophical perspective. The one small reproach is that there wasn't much facilitation of discussion, the hour after the general introductions to the topics felt more like a question and answer session than a true seminar-style setting with students being able to talk to and respond to one another. But this is to be expected given the expertise of the teaching faculty. All in all an excellent, rewarding and enriching course.
Fascinating topics in philosophy with great professors, and a diverse group of students who bring a range of perspectives to the issues discussed in class.  Take it!
A great course for anyone who wants to think deeply about hard questions in contemporary political theory.
Sen and Nelson were a wonderful duo. If you have the opportunity to take this class you must.
