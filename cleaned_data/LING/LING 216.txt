I think semantics is wonderful, although it's not for everyone.  I strongly suggest familiarizing yourself with basic logic (including quantification) prior to semantics I and modal logic prior to semantics II.  It's not strictly necessary, but having this background will make everything enormously easier.
Gennaro is brilliant and discusses great stuff. However, he goes on frustrating tangents just as frequently, so beware.
This is an excellent course in semantics. Gennaro is a fantastic instructor who will always make the time to ensure that every student understands the difficult material.
Very interesting course. Prof. Chierchia is very enthusiastic. Lecture notes can be a bit unclear at times, but Chierchia's "Meaning and Grammar", and Heim and Kratzer's "Semantics in Generative Grammar" are very helpful supplements. Course prepares you well for current literature in semantics. Assignments are not a lot of work, and final squib is interesting to write.
The course is very good for grounding your understanding of semantics. It is a very difficult field but reveals a lot of interesting problems of mapping language to logic. Class can be difficult and confusing because the material is difficult, but ask questions in class as much as you can and meet with Professor Chierchia one-on-one if you are confused as he is extremely helpful and accommodating.
The name of Prof. Chierchia is already a self-explanatory reason to choose this course.This course focuses on several important topics in semantics, which will give you a foundation to do semantics research in the future.If you are interested in semantic research, you can't miss this course.And personally, this course was among the best courses I took during my visit to Harvard.
This course is not easy, but it is well worth the effort.
