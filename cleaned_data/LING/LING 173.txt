This was my first introduction to linguistics, and I really enjoyed it! If you have any interest in Japanese grammar and how it's different from other languages, I strongly recommend that you take this course. Professor Jacobsen is incredibly kind and engaging, and the material is varied and interesting.
This is a small class and is a lot of fun if you are interested in Japanese and linguistics.  The class really benefits you as a Japanese language learner, and also provides a lot of insight on how to look at languages, and how Japanese compares with English.
I would definitely take this class if you are interested in Japanase or language in general. For non-native speakers, it will help your Japanese, though that is not the purpose. You will learn about a variety of topics and develop critical reasoning skills.
Professor Jacobsen is both highly knowledgeable and highly approachable. The course material is interesting if you have any interest in either Japanese or in Linguistics
It's a good class, but don't expect it to as interactive as a Japanese class. After all, it is linguistics.
I really loved this class. The work was minimal, and I really feel like my understanding of all of the Japanese I've been learning for years was deepened. (Many a time during a Japanese exam I even called upon what I learned from this class to help me figure out proper grammatical structures, etc). Highly recommend for those interested in Japanese/trying to find EAS-related classes that are light on work but strong in content.
