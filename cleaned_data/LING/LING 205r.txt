A great class, well worth taking.
Make use of Wikipedia and other sources online to get an introduction to the topic covered in class... Without a base of introductory knowledge, at times it is impossible to follow the discussion in class
I find questions to be a fascinating topic, and Andreea is very engaging
A lot of reading work, but well worth it for a thorough grounding in a wide range of important literature.
