If you are interesting in phonology, you will likely end up in this course. Kevin does a good job teaching about not just linguistics, but also about statistics, a little programming, and how to work with corpora, which are helpful not just in phonology but in all branches of the field.
The most useful part of this course (if you are not planning on going into phonology) is the statistics and corpus training. Very, very important to have a course in this at some point.
Take this class if you took the first semester of phonology! It's a great next step from the first semester and the computational methods you learn, while basic, are a great introduction to how to apply computational methods to linguistics, no matter what field you do.
