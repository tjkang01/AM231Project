This course is a wonderful introduction to the Hittite language.
Any aspiring Indo-Europeanist must be exposed to Hittite, and Prof. Rau's way of doing that is actually quite effective, as long as you do all the required exercises.
A good introduction to a fascinating and important language. Be prepared to work hard--the course moves very quickly.
Very interesting class and Professor Rau is a great teacher who has deep knowledge of Hittite and Indo-European. Be prepared to spend a lot of time on the homework and translation and studying for the midterm and final.
