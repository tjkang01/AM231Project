It's a good opportunity to prepare for your generals paper or any independent research and present it in front of your cohorts.
Enjoy your presentations and do not get exhausted about them throughout your preparation..
Take it if you are very career-minded and want to learn some inside tips. Otherwise, it's not very useful. Advice often borders on unethical, so if you are the honest-intellectual type, be prepared to be challenged.
Fantastic venue for asking any questions you have about getting a PhD, TFing, and what to do after the dissertation.
