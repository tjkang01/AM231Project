This is a good, in depth introduction to optimality theory in phonology, taking it a step further than the rule-based method gone over in intro linguistics/intro phonology. The problem sets aren't too bad and Kevin's class handouts are helpful.
The class is a lot of fun. Kevin is great (as you surely know if you've taken 105) and he's very interested in the topic, besides knowing a lot about it. Ask him about his accent; he's from Wisconsin and proud of it.
This class isn't too hard--most of the information is nicely packaged for you in the weekly handouts, so just going to class and paying attention to the little demonstrations should be sufficient to grasping most of the content. On a theoretical level, it really challenged my conceptions of phonology that I had after taking the introductory course, and I felt that it really helped me grow as a linguist.
An up-to-date, comprehensive, and overall excellent introduction to Phonological Theory. The course is well thought-out, and the assignments are quite fun, too!
It will make you familiar with the major models used in modern phonology and give you a general solid grounding in the field.The assignments will certainly require some work, but it really pays off.
