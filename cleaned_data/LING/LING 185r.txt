If you're a linguistics student with a knowledge and appreciation for syntax, this class is a very refreshing introduction to a language family one might not interact with too much in a non-specialist context.
This class is interesting and the professor is very good -- but make sure you have a strong grounding in syntax or you may find yourself struggling to learn a lot of terminology.
You MUST take the class!
