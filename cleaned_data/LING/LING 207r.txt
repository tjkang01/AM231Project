Just wonderful.
This course allows a lot of flexibility for going more in depth on a specific area within the overarching class topic and provides students with a good background for doing so.
A lot of reading work, but well worth it for a thorough grounding in a wide range of important literature.
The reading workload is very heavy, and some of the concepts quite difficult compared to anything in prior courses. The class is fascinating, though. Worth taking if you are really into syntax or semantics.
