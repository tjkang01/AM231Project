Very difficult but sharpens the mind
Frankly, this course is outside my area of interest, but I would recommend it to those interested in medieval Slavic culture or early Russian Orthodoxy
It's very hard and time-consuming, but Michael Flier is a very engaging teacher.
It is worth taking, even if it feels something like torture while you're agonizing over noun declensions and strange forms. You bond with your classmates like you've been through a traumatic ordeal, and you'll always have something to joke about with others who have taken it. For Slavic grad students, it's a rite of passage, and for some, even an enjoyable one. You'll look at sentences like puzzles, and Russian will never look the same.
Work in study groups. Ask as many questions as you need to understand.
