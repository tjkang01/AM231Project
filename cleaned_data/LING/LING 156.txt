This course was an amazing introduction to Bantu languages but even more so allowed me to synthesize my knowledge of different subfields of linguistics to critically examine the structure of languages I was not familiar with and to develop and test theories of how Bantu languages, and language in general, work. Not only did this course change what I knew about Bantu languages but also changed the way I view language in general. Also, Professor Van der Wal was one of the sweetest, most enthusiastic, and most supportive professors I have ever had.
An amazing class that really gets across how important crosslinguistic work is in testing theories that have been largely developed around Western European languages.
