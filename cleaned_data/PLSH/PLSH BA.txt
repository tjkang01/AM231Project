The class is manageable, but the language is definitely difficult
Take it! Polish is fun! You do lots of translation and reading, and it's all a very good selection.
This is a great class with a great professor. Pani Baraczak is enthusiastic and is excellent in her craft of teaching. The course can be a bit frustrating at times if you're learning Polish with absolutely no prior knowledge (besides taking Slavic Da and Db), as those who have a previous familial background with the language come equipped with a much broader vocabulary than students who are coming in without prior speaking/listening experience.
Be prepared to do a lot of studying/learning on your own. This course is less guided than the two previous levels.
Overall, this course did what I wanted it to do: it improved my Polish speaking, reading, and writing. I felt more proficient in Polish at the end of the semester than I did at the beginning.
This is a fun class that will help you to hone and expand your skills in the Polish language.
So much fun to be had. Take this class, Pani Baranczak is the best. The readings is this class were A+ because she was responsive to the interest of the student. She is willing to tailor the class to varying interests.
This course is very hlepful for anyone who has some basic Polish language skills, and seeks to improve their listening and reading comprehension. The course offers a great opportunity to learn language through reading and discussion of various texts. Grammar and vocabulary are introducedthrough reading the texts, which is  a great way to learn.
