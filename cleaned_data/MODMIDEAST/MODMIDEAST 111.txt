Lectures are very unfocused and unorganized. The material is presented pretty dryly and gets very boring. I was very interested in Iran and still am, but did not get the overview of the culture that I expected.
Interesting lecture and a painless gen ed.
You really have to do the readings to appreciate what the course is teaching.
