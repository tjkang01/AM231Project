This was a really unique opportunity to learn about the Conflict with a professor who really knows what he's talking about and not afraid to tackle tough questions.
The course requires a lot of self-motivation. This might seem weird given how little work the class actually involves, however you will not get anything out of it if you do not do the readings and pay attention in class. Professor Morris is an icon in the field and it is interesting to hear his perspective.
Course by Prof. Benny Morris are not to be missed!
Definitely take this incredible opportunity to learn about the Arab-Zionist Conflict from one of the premier experts on the topic.
If this class is ever offered again at Harvard, it's definitely worth taking. You'll learn a lot about an important period in history through a series of great lectures and readings.
