Take this course. Dr. Kahn provides an stressful environment to learn about Israel, a fascinating yet often controversial country in academic discourse. The workload is manageable and you will be given ample opportunity to succeed.
One of my favorite classes taken at Harvard. Prof Kahn was amazing, the material was fascinating and the course was a great way to conduct discussion on Israeli culture y looking at it from its fringes. I loved this course!
