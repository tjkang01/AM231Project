Prepare yourself for the most Odyssean experience of Harvard. There is no guidance along the way; not even divine intervention could help you. Often times, I wished a car would hit me on my way to class to diffuse the pain this course caused; facing scylla and charybdis would have been an easier task than surviving this course.
Literally the best engineering course I've taken at Harvard. 
Both Needleman and Mooney are great lecturers and AWESOME people in general. 
The material itself is extremely enjoyable. Very applicable, and actually fun to go through. The textbook is almost as good as the lectures, which really set the bar high.
The psets were the right level of challenging, which is uncommon for SEAS.
Overall, do take this course if you have even the slightest interest in chemical engineering. BE160 was literally the highlight of my semester.
There is little I can offer in terms of advice for this class, as this was the first time it was offered and I'm not sure what changes they will implement. This has the potential to be a good course, if more people (20+, as opposed to 5) enrolled and if it was taught with a real section component and office hours.
