Great class that will broaden your horizons on what has been done and currently is being worked on in the field of cell engineering. You will definitely learn a lot of very interesting topics, such as why DNA is a 4-letter system and how to expand the genetic alphabet.
The material covered in this course is really cool and one of the greatest strengths of the course is the lab component, which is optional, but I would definitely recommend doing it. It was a great opportunity to do an independent research project, even though it is a lot of work.
The lab component of the class was very fun and I felt like I learned a lot (it added a lot more work to the class than the lecture component had, however).
Great class that informs you the current state of synthetic biology. Teaches you a lot of practical advice in terms of proposal writing and presenting innovative science.
Fascinating material, not stressful, professor is good.
