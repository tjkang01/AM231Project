This class is a really cool way to explore topics in motor learning, computational neuroscience, neuroengineering, and systems dynamics. The psets are hard and ability to code in MATLAB is a must. The workload is really variable; some weeks there's no hw and others I spent 10-15hrs working on a pset or paper presentation.
The lecture material was interesting but the course was extremely disorganized. There was not much material variety, and there were only 3 psets during the entire semester. So take it if you need a low-key engineering requirement, but not if you're hoping to learn a lot about neural control. We learned the basics and some interesting mathematical models for learning, but nothing beyond that
In terms of the material and Professor Smith's knowledge of the subject, this is a fantastic course.  There is just enough bioogy to ground the quantitative analysis in something applicable. But the mechanics of this course still need to be worked out a bit.  The psets were challenging but manageable and the two paper presentations were a good alternative to psets as well.
