The course is good, but the material is only truly reinforced if one does both close reading and very good notes for the lectures. While the grading is fair, the course most certainly cannot be taken lightly.
This is a fun, accessible way to get significant background in Ancient Near Eastern studies. Having been meaning to take this type of class for many years, I can say that it was definitely worth the effort!
The material makes the course. Ancient Near Eastern History is both fun and fascinating. Since only someone who agrees with this statement could ever possibly teach this the course, it will always be a winner, no matter the teacher, and whether taking the course on a whim, to satisfy a requirement, or as part of an academic focus.
If you are not taking this class for concentration requirement, then make sure you have an interest in Ancient Near Eastern history. Try to do all the readings, or at least skim them. They give you a much more fleshed out picture of the things you study in class, and help you reinforce what was taught in lecture.
Professor Barjamovic brings to life a period of history that is all-to-often opaque to modern students. Those who remember being bored by middle school textbooks on the Fertile Crescent and the advent of agriculture will be thrilled to discover in this class the richness, relevance, and fascination of this 3000 year period of the Ancient World. You will not regret investing your time in this course!
It is a fantastic introduction to ancient Sumerian History.
Excellent teacher
This course provides a thorough and animated tour of the ancient Near East. It is extremely well-taught and engages its student with various economic, political, and social theories concerning the world's potentially earliest cities and empires.
