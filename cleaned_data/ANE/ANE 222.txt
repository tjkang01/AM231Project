A lot of reading, and a lot of writing, but well worth your time. I doubt very much that this course will ever be evaluated on the Q. I honestly don't know any student at the PhD level who even knows what the Q is, or would care to read its ratings. But then again I live a fairly cloistered life.
I recommend it fully and without reserve to anybody with an interest in Biblical criticism.
