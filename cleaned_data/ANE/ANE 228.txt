The class was a fun and engaging overview of the history of Jerusalem, which would provide an ample introduction to entice students to further study.
This class is amazing. Professor Levine is very good and the material is great. I loved doing the reading, which literally never happens.
Be familiar with the readings and be prepared to have an opinion on contentious topics
