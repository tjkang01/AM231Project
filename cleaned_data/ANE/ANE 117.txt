If you're at all interested in the archaeology of the Ancient Near East or in the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament, this course will captivate you. You're likely to learn a lot about the Bible that you didn't learn in Sunday School.
If you are looking for a class that gives a proper and thorough  introduction into the field of biblical archaeology this class is a great fit for you.
If, like me, you use the frequency of "aha!" moments in a course to determine it's worth, this is as close to a perfect class as you'll find. There is learning that pushes the borders of your understanding, and there is learning that erases those borders entirely and draws completely new lines. The former should be expected in any class, but the latter is hard to find. This course had both, and in abundance. I would give it my highest recommendation to any student, regardless of academic interest, and without reserve.
