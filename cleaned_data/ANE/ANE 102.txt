You wouldn't believe how many gods the Mesopotamians had!
This class was extremely interesting and the readings were long but informative, though without a language background of Akkadian/Sumerian (which I don't have), it was difficult sometimes to keep up.  Prof. Steinkeller is a fantastic teacher though!
