Interesting class but very focused on philosophy as opposed to global health issues. First week of class is not super representative of the semester.
Unless the course is going to be changed substantially, I would not take this course. It was really dry and I didn't get much out of it. This is also not a global health course, but instead a basic introductory philosophy course.
This class turned out to be a philosophy class on distributive justice, not really having anything to do with healthcare. Take if you are interested in dense philosophy.
this is one of those courses that helps you grow as a human being and become a better person. If you've ever asked yourself how you can make a positive impact on the world or want to think about the underlying, difficult ethical choices in healthcare policy, this is a great class. Be warned, it's basically an introductory level philosophy class with a particular focus on applications in healthcare. Small class size means you really get to participate and get to know peers. Nir is a gem of a human being, loves the material and really wants to get to know undergrads (and he brings snacks every week!). Readings are a bit dense but weekly work is super chill. Great for all academic backgrounds, but especially if you are pre-med this class highlights a lot of very difficult and relevant moral questions that truly thoughtful doctors must consider. And at the end of the day (if this class continues to be sponsored, hopefully) you get to make a massive donation to a truly important cause - even if you've accomplished nothing else this semester, being able to make this positive impact feels good.
