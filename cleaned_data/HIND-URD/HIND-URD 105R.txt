Prof. Delacy is a great instructor and has a good command of Urdu and Hindi. It was great getting to explore the literature more with him this semester
Richard is great. You will get out what you put in.
Extremely fun!
This is an easy going class to take if you have a busy semester or just want to maintain your Hindi/Urdu. You'll read and watch some great pieces. You won't  have to work very hard which is nice but you might not make significant progress.
