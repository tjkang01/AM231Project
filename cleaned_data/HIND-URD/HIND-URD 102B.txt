Richard ji is one of my most favorite professors on this campus. The way he explains things helps makes sense of them. He is concerned about whether or not you have learned which may bring some ambiguity in regards to the grading system
I would recommend this course as an opportunity to practice one's Hindi/Urdu. However, the course left much to be desired in terms of testing students' vocabulary, grammar, and cultural knowledge.
It's my favorite class because I enjoy studying the language and am passionate about India. You will enjoy the company of so many like-minded students who also love the language and regions of South Asia. The mix of undergraduate and graduate students also creates a unique dynamic, and Professor Delacy encourages students in their language growth.
The course is well structured and thought out.
For anyone who is interested in studying or traveling to India or Pakistan, this is a necessary and essential course.
Excellent class!
This class is your opportunity to learn Hindi-Urdu from one of the most enthusiastic and expert professors you will ever meet. Richard-ji's voluminous knowledge may be intimidating, but he is incredibly kind and willing to meet you wherever you are. Don't let the year go by without meeting with him to work out your language difficulties, but also to hear his amazing stories.
