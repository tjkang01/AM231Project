My language skills improved a lot during the semester. There is a surprising amount of work in the course, so be prepared for that.
This is an excellent course for students of South Asia generally and for those with an interest in current affairs or history specifically. Students will emerge with strong skills relating to Hindi-Urdu media.
A lot of new vocab - the learning curve is steep but rewarding.
