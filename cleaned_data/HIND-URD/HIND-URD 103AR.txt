This was the one class that I looked forward to each day I had it.  It was meaningful, enjoyable, useful, helpful, and just awesome.  Professor Delacy is one of the best professors that Harvard has and he takes his responsibility very seriously, however, he stresses that he learns by teaching, too and is always up for discussing the different things the class studies.
you reap what you sow. if you want to learn more, Richard Ji would be all out to help you.
As always, any class with Richard Delacy ends up being among the best courses I've taken at Harvard. We read poetry, watch films, and get an amazing understanding of the culture. Richard is also the funniest instructor I've had in my life. I would do anything to keep taking classes with him. He is super understanding and works to strengthen your weaknesses. His class is catered towards you. Do yourself a favor and take this class!
You'll look forward to these classes every week. Richardji creates a fun and relaxed environment and you get exposure to some great films and literature.
It's a big jump up from 102 so make sure you revise grammar and vocab in your own time. It would also be great to keep up your Urdu/ Hindi over the summer as I was rusty when I came back and had to catch up again.
Put in as much time and effort as you can, because Richard will be sure to meet you halfway. He is very detailed and thoughtful in his feedback, and makes a strong effort to understand the interest and needs of each of his students. He is a great resource all around.
You have to put in a lot of work to get a lot out of this class. It's up to you. Richard-ji is very helpful, of course.
Richard Delacy is a fantastic teacher!
