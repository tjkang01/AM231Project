This is a difficult language if you have no background in East Asian languages.
The course offers a unique perspective on Tibetan thought processes and literary heritage. The language and grammar are not very challenging, which means that it boils down almost to simple vocabulary memorization. The few grammatical points that do exist seem to be very flexible, which can be frustrating.
This class is difficult and requires dedication and concentration, but if you are willing to put in the time to take it you will be pleasantly surprised at the depth of the readings and the Tibetan canon and the teacher will take the time to help you understand.
