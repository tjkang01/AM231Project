This was an amazing course. Not only will you gain exposure to two important works in the Buddhist logic and epistemology text tradition, but you will also benefit from a fascinating philological experience through comparing the Sanskrit, Tibetan, and Chinese editions of the Nyyapravea. I highly recommend this course!
