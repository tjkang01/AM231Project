This is an excellent course for the intermediate student, emphasizing a strong foundation in grammar and vocabulary, but also providing plenty of challenge and opportunity for more advanced work.
The course is very helpful for those who want to be exposed to different genres of Tibetan literature.
Rory is an encouraging professor who makes you feel comfortable learning Tibetan. This level is great preparation for studying Tibetan texts as a scholar, and will help you gain confidence in your reading skills.
Great class and a "must" for anyone who wants to really understand Classical Tibetan.
