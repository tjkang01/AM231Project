This course is a good way to improve your Tibetan and knowledge of Indo-Tibetan philosophy through further exposure to the material, but it is not a good idea to take this class if your Tibetan is not very good and don't know much about this kind of philosophy. The amount of work required of the course could make it overwhelming.
The course will push you, but it's well worth the effort - your Tibetan will definitely improve and you will also grow as a scholar.  It's an amazing learning experience.
It will be great to take this course if you plan to continue Tibetan studies. Prof. van der Kuijp is a great model of passionate and meticulous scholarship. But you have to make sure you have a good grounding on Tibetan language and a passion/interest for Madhyamika philosophy.
