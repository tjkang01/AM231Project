This course will enhance your ability in understanding the grammar structure of classic Tibetan.
This teacher is outstanding and it is a necessary bridge between elementary and advanced Tibetan.
It's a great course, so if you have in interest in Classical Tibetan and/or Tibetan Buddhist philosophical texts/literature, then by all means take this course!
Rory is a great, personable teacher.
I would highly recommend this class to students interested in Tibetan translation. The instructor provides the right amount of challenge and support for helping us broaden our skills in what is a difficult language to master.
