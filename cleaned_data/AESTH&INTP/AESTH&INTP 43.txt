It's very cool and will involve great field trips.
Arguably the top living scholar writing about classical Ottoman art, it was an honor to be in Prof. Necipolu's class. Her extremely elegant and polite demeanor, willingness to respond to my questions, and patience made this semester really unique for me. Of course, she drew on her previous writing and scholarship for her lectures, but in her presence, I learned what to pay attention to. Her teaching has such a distinct flavor that it immediately sticks, and I am sure I will remember many details for years to come. I cannot wait to go back to Istanbul, and see all the sights we discussed during the course!
A very interesting class that helps you connect the dots in a lot of historic matters. It is, however, more arts history oriented than history itself, so for those who aren't interested in architecture, art, or design, beware.
This class provides an amazing insight into Ottoman art and architecture, creates a better idea of Islamic art in general and its branches in specific, demonstrates how changes in the lives of rulers and people affected the development of art and architecture, and offers a perspective on how cultural, political, and economic interactions within the Ottoman Empire and between the Empire and foreign countries affected the Ottoman visual culture.
