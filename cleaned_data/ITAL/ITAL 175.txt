I would definitely recommend this course. It was useful because I learnt how to make my own ideas on many different themes of italian literature and culture.
It is a difficult class with lots and lots of readings, and it's really necessary to be committed.  Also, you have to like studying the 20th century, and you have to like cinema at least a little bit - it's central to the course's composition.  There is quite a bit of theory at the beginning of the course, and it's really necessary to devote a lot of time to reading and understanding it.
