There is no better way to get motivated and excited about what you are working on than to hear someone talk about their success in your field and actually read their work and get to dialogue with them about it.
Take this course!
This is one of the best things we do. It is important as a gesture of respect and as a way to broaden horizons. You get out of it as much as you put in. Read the books you like and take your time and write a good review. If the book is no good, just read enough that you won't be bored at the presentation.
a very interesting class
