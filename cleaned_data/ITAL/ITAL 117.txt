you can put minimum effort into this class (just watch the films and write average discussion posts) but it will not help you with your final paper.  invest your time and be thoughtful in your  posts throughout the semester.
The grading can be a bit harsh at times, but the class is really interesting! Italian cinema is so fascinating and this class does a great job in going about discussing it. The workload is a bit more than you'd imagine, just because watching the movies and writing responses does take some time, but it's definitely all really interesting. Most definitely would recommend!
Learned more about the films that about migration.
