This is a great way to get in touch with Italian culture through one of its premier contemporary genres.
I'd wholeheartedly recommend this course to anyone with a grasp of the Italian language!!!!!! I was so sad to hear that Grazia is leaving. However, she organized an excellent structure for the class that I hope another teacher with interest in the material could offer something with a similar focus.
