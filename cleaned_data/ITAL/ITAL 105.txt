This class was a great way to engage further with Italian language and culture. The layout--having more traditional, classroom learning one day of the week and cooking on the other--added variety to the course and kept it interesting. The workload is pretty high, but I found it worth the while. Professor DiFabio is a wonderful instructor who cares about her students as people and not just as students, and the personal effort that she put into the course showed. I would recommend the course for both the topic itself but also for the professor. If you take Italian, you should definitely try to have Professor DiFabio for at least one course.
Very fun class that teaches about the different histories of italian food culture. Meets Tuesdays for lecture, thursdays in the kitchen for food.
This class is a great way to look at Italian culture through one of its finest aspects - food. The readings, while hefty, are extremely varied and interesting and Elvira is a wonderful and caring professor.
This course was in some ways the highlight of my semester. I suspect that it will be even better the second time around with some of the bugs ironed out. It is truly a hidden gem in the course catalog that you should not pass up.
It's a lot of reading but very enjoyable and delicious. Enjoy it!
This is the best course I've taken at Harvard. Hands down. DiFabio is energetic, warm, and encouraging. The material is superbly interesting and is fine-tuned to get students comfortable in the Italian kitchen, with the Italian language, and amidst some of the greatest works of literature on the subject of culinary history.
This class is so much fun! If you keep up with the Artusi readings, you will get a lot out of the class. 2.5 hours of speaking Italian each week will make you a better speaker. Not to mention Elvira's insight into your writing will advance your written skills. It is hard to think of an Italian course that better combines fun and active learning!
