This course, although set up for graduates and undergraduates, this year was mostly graduate students, and it made it difficult for constructive conversation. Shop the course though. Gerusalemme Liberata is a great book and Professor Erspamer really knows the subject. The coursework isn't terribly difficult either and is a good foreign language literature course.
