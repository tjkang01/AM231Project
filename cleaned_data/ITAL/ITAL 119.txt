This gem of a course will keep you interested and won't drain you of life and spirit.
It was a great way to think about the role of film in society and analyze things that we do not necessarily see the first time we watch a film.
This course is a wonderful introduction to Italian cinema. I found the films to be thought-provoking and the discussions engaging. Moreover, the workload is very manageable, as Adam emphasizes quality over quantity. Also, there is an opportunity for a creative project at the end of the course, which I really appreciated. Overall, the course spurred my creativity while strengthening my analytical skills.
Take this class. its a gem, and actually really interesting. It was well planned for a first time course and I can only see it improving.
One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard.
This is a great elective; totally manageable workload, really great movies, awesome teaching staff.  Definitely take it if you're looking for a chill class to compliment a tougher schedule (i.e. spring thesis season, etc...)
