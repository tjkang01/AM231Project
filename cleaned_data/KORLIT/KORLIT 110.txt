Fantastic course to get you well acquainted with a field that is not explored by many. The course is very thoughtfully designed to cover a lot of materials, but with great depth, if you'd like. Professor Park is one in a million - you should take a class with her if you're at all interested in learning about Korea, but also she is so knowledgeable about Japan and China - a fantastic teacher all around.
