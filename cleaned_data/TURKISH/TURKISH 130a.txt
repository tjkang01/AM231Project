This was an excellent class and a great opportunity to improve my Turkish. Our teacher did a great job adjusting to different levels and never failed to come up with interesting and insightful material.
This course will help you in gaining informed impressions about modern Turkey
This is good if you want to get better at reading Turkish, not if you want to speak in Turkish
