I would make it very clear to the student that this class is a lot of work and so not to take it lightly. However, if the student is really determined to learn the language and feel that he/she obtained all necessary materials to understand many difficult constructions, then this is a good course for the student.
You will end the year understanding a new language. It's incredible.
If you have an incredibly strong will and know that Turkey is in your future, sign up! Be warned that this course will push you to your limits with mind boggling amounts of homework and difficult grammar concepts. That said, Turkish class is always an adventure with a great class community. Himmet Hoca truly cares about his students and the class is tight knit after a year of communal struggle.
Expect to spend two hours a day on Turkish, but know that you will be learning from a very knowledgable professor and will learn Turkish quite quickly.
