Ottoman Turkish is very challenging.  Himmet is excellent at inviting students into the strange and wonderful world of Ottoman texts without letting the experience be discouraging or overwhelming.
Turkish speakers, don't believe the propaganda that Ottoman Turkish is impossibly difficult to learn and read!  With Himmet Bey you will see that Ottoman texts can be quite simple and easily accessible, and they unleash a wide world of sources that can only enrich our understanding of the social, cultural and literary history of a region that spanned from Morocco in the West to Iran in the East and from Darfur in the South to Austria in the North.
I think a good attitude is most necessary for this course. Learning Ottoman Turkish is a lifelong process, it is difficult and everyone needs to work hard, even native Turkish speakers. There are no short-cuts, one just has to dutifully keep working at it. Some students who grew up in the US/west may have found this challenging; some raised concerns in class. But you just have to hunker down and work on all the texts we read in class, that is how we can build up our foundations, to read the sources and then formulate arguments based on that groundwork. I feel many students who had trouble with Ottoman classes wanted to fly before they could walk. Professor Taskomur was very generous and patient with all these students, even though some of them brought their frustration to class; I admire his magnanimity. In my opinion he is the best instructor at Harvard for both Ottoman history and Ottoman Turkish.
