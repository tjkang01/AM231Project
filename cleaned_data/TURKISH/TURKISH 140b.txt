Professor Taskomur is a wonderful teacher!  It's rare to find an instructor at Harvard who shows genuine care about students' learning experience.   Graduate students should strive to know him.  His knowledge is vast.  This class doesn't just teach you the basics of a language; it also trains you to analyze texts from the perspective of a historian.
You will likely never again have a chance to take an Ottoman Turkish class, so take it even though it does require much time and effort. It's incredibly difficult but really rewarding when you make progress. Himmet Hoca is really helpful and does absolutely everything that he can do to ensure that everyone is learning.
This course is one of the finest academic experiences I have had at Harvard, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in the history, culture, and language of Ottoman and modern Turkey. Professor Takmr possesses a boundless reservoir of knowledge on the aforementioned topics, and he is also an astute commentator on intellectual history, religion, and art. While studying Ottoman Turkish under him, you will become familiar with the main intellectual undercurrents of the late Ottoman scene; you may also be regaled with fascinating anecdotes, lines of poetry, and linguistic esoterica. This class seriously improved my ability to read and translate the Ottoman language, and it added greatly to my understanding of both Ottoman and modern Turkey. A gem in Harvard's course catalog.
