This is an absolutely essential course for anybody wishing to work with Ottoman material. Professor Takomur is a gem and I am very fortunate to have the chance to have studied under him.
Although challenging, this is ultimately a very rewarding class.
Some texts are very difficult, so don't hesitate to seek help from Himmet Hoca or your classmates. Himmet Hoca is more than happy to go over the difficult sections of the text during his office hours.
Himmet Taskomur is an excellent teacher. His command of the Arabic, Persian and modern Turkish languages makes this course much more interesting and engaging.
