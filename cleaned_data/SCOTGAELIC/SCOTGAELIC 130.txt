There aren't too many times that you'll be able to go study Scottish Gaelic. It's a fascinating language and the professor is great!
This is the best language class ever! The professor and TF are awesome, and you really learn the material. Definitely put this on your shopping list!
Best language class I've taken so far. A lot of fun. Small class. Learn a lot.
