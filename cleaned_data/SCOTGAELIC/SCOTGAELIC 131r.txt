Wonderful course. More work and a lot more challenging than the first semester, but very worthwhile and a lot of fun.
Scottish Gaelic is a great language, and the professor and the TF were awesome. I definitely found this semester more challenging than the previous one probably due to the fact that we had moved on from the basic language skills. The added translation component improved my translation skills but was also very time consuming. Despite the challenges, I would highly recommend the course.
