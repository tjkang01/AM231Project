this is one of the best things you can do for yourself as you write your dissertation.  in addition to feedback and motivation, you  are rewarded with a sense of collegial spirit and collaboration in a process that can be very lonely and isolating.  Forming relationships with colleagues outside your section and taking in their contributions is just as important (if not more so) than working with students within your own section.
I can't recommend this course enough. Please take advantage of it!
If you would like feedback from peers on work, while in the process of writing your dissertation or a conference paper, then this is an excellent class.
Great way to work on your thesis!! Very, very helpful.
