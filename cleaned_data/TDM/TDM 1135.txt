This is a great class because of the variety of theory, methodology, and subject-matter in the papers assigned. While there were more classic texts/scholars such as Foucault, the class included a number of present-day work which allows you to become acquainted with current scholarship on race, gender, and sexuality. The class is very accessible and would be good for students who are simply interested in the subject matter as well as students in the humanities and social sciences looking for new theories and methodologies that might be useful to their works.
Performance studies is an amazing field that everyone should study. With that said, do not take this course unless you're ready to think pretty hard--some of this theory is pretty tough.
