This is a great course if anything because it just attracted a super interesting, woke group of people who would get together and discuss very current, critical political issues. The readings are also carefully curated and very stimulating. Be prepared to have the onus for productive discussion on you, however--Professor Huang mostly observes and facilitates.
This course still feels like it is finding its feet as far as assignments and discussion, but Prof. Huang is an incredible resource and the content is super interesting.
This class is very discussion-based and wrestles with some complex texts. You definitely need to do the reading in order to get anything out of the course.
