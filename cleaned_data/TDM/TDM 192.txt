This class is unique and unlike most theater courses. James provides students with historical readings that help students develop the necessary tools to stage the final performance. Also, an immersive theatrical is a lot more fun than its mundane versions, both for the performers and the audience. Take this class and do the readings. You may not be a better performer at the end but will develop a solid basis of theoretical knowledge to do so whenever you please. The final staged performance was very rushed, but I'm sure James will take care of that in the next iterations to come.
This class is super cool because it actually encourages you to produce a body of work. Unlike some other TDM classes where you just learn about past works or discuss potential new works, this class has you making theatre all the time. Plus the course materials are super interesting and James is amazing.
