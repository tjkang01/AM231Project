If you love poetry and are interested what precolonial India had to say about poetics, then this course will be an ocean of bliss! "The Joy of the Waterlily" of Apayya is exactly for curious children like us.
Be prepared to put in extra study time. Study groups were helpful outside the classroom
Reading with Professor Watson is enjoyable and you learn a lot. He is scrupulous when it comes to the smallest details of the text and has great knowledge, particularly of Sanskrit philosophy
Best if you find a small group to work with outside of class. Alex is a great teacher: thoughtful, gentle, knowledgable.
Take this and don't ever quit reading Sanskrit or you will most certainly lose your hard earned skills.
