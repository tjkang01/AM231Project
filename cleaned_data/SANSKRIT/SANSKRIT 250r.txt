This is an excellent chance to read Sanskrit at a high level in a more relaxed format. I would recommend it to those students who have the preparation and who are interested in the topic.
A great opportunity to read with a group of students who have a lot of experience with Sanskrit texts and a great flexible course structure suited for either moving through material or spending a lot of time worrying about small textual details, which also can be rewarding, in doses.
If you are interested in logic, in Indian philosophy, and in new intellecutals, Navya Nyaya will have many surprises for you, and this course will be a smooth transition into its tiger-like dire (vyghramukh) language and concepts.
This course will help  understand not only the discussion of semantic theories about root endings in the Nyaya tradition. It gives exposure to views of various traditional disciplines and explains why this topic has been  important for centuries to many Indian intellectuals from different disciplines.
This class is difficult, but worth taking if you love Sanskrit, and are interesting in thinking about how intellectuals in pre-modern India thought and argued.
Parimal seemed to get defensive with some questions and suggestions. He can make things more confusing than they need to be--for whatever reasons.  He does not allow some students to read at all, or worse reads *for* them.  This did not create an atmosphere where they could learn by presenting their own reading. A lot of students (in particular the women) noticed this and it created a feeling that he didn't think they were "good enough." The "good" people were more seasoned Sanskrit readers, so his approach was unfair.
This course will give you better understanding of Buddhist philosophy and also teach you good Sanskrit reading skills.
