Sanskrit is the most difficult and at times frustrating language I have ever studied but it is also very rewarding.
Just a continuation of 102b, we read the Meghaduta and Vetalapancavimsati.
It is a wonderful class and Prof. Watson is so nice and accessible.
Take Sanskrit!
Be prepared to work hard and learn a lot.
Study Sanskrit! And study hard!
This is the class where reading Sanskrit finally felt less like solving a math formula and more like experiencing text. Also Parimal is delightful. High expectations motivate  hard work, with a llot of care and patience to balance it out. Couldn't have asked for better from the belly of the Sanskrit fear-mongering machine. I had a wonderful time.
Prof. Patil is the best. He will definitely challenge you and expects you to come to class over-prepared but he is also super supportive and will meet you where you are in terms of ability and confidence in the language. The class was not easy by any means but simply be keeping up, you learn so much.
You will continue to build your knowledge from the previous semester.
If you are interested in Sanskrit literature of any kind, then this class is an absolute MUST to get your foundations in grammar, genre and commentary in place.
