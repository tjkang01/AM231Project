I took this course because I thought it would be important for my research, and it meets a course requirement for my program. While I certainly learned a lot, I don't feel that I have a cohesive picture of radio astronomy at all. I struggled through the problem sets and had to ask for help a lot. The topics we covered seemed very disjoint, and I would find it difficult to apply any of them in a practical way. The lab assignments were very difficult but, at the very least, illustrated the concepts from class in a hands-on way that made them easier to understand.
I thought it was going to be more about the science of radio astronomy when the majority of the class was about the antenna systems.
I would emphasize that the course focuses on the technical aspects of radio astronomy, and is as such a particularly useful course for those seeking to become radio astronomers or utilize radio data.
It's good to learn how radio astronomy works!
A brilliantly taught course by an instructor who is an expert on the subject - this course leaves almost nothing to be desired. Expect to be masters of the understanding of Radio Astronomy!
Great class, though lots of work.
The course covers a lot of signal processing and observation techniques but is not very concerned with astrophysical phenomena.  For those who want to do radio astronomy, rather than those who want to learn about radio sources.
With enough effort can learn quite a bit.
Jim has a wonderful didactic style.  Unfortunately, the textbook is hard to learn from, so make sure to attend all lectures!
A must-take for all observers (not only radio astronomers).
I found this to be a wonderful and invaluable class.  For someone who has an interest in radio astronomy, there is not a better class to take.  You will learn all about the field from a true expert!
