This class is a gem in the astrophysics department. I recommend that every astronomer take this class. Some of the analytic theory you learn is applicable to many areas of astrophysics.
It will take up a LOT of your time.
This class was an exceptional amount of work for a survey course. If you are planning on going into high energy astrophysics for your research, I would recommend this course. However, if you are simply looking for an interesting elective, I would recommend other courses.
Edo and Ramesh are great lecturers and much more coordinated than the average teaching team.  This course hits a lot of interesting topics, but doesn't go very deep because of time constraints.  Be warned, it is more work than the average astro grad course, but not unreasonable.
Good course, covers a wide range of interesting topics.
This course is excellent when Professor Narayan is teaching it.  He is a superb lecturer (if slow at times) and he picks topics well.  The coverage is good for anyone remotely interested in the topic - I went from slightly interested in high-energy astrophysics to very interested because of this one course.  However, Professor Grindlay may be an excellent scientist, but his lectures and problem sets are really a waste of time.  This class was still a net positive experience, but only barely.  I'd say give it a try and see if Professor Grindlay has gotten any better... I got the sense he wasn't really trying very hard, and maybe if he did it would go better.
The instructors in this class are like goldmines in relation to this subject. You need to make sure you take advantage of this resource. Ask them questions as much as possible
