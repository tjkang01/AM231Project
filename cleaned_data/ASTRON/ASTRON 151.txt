A good intro to fluid dynamics with some applications to astrophysics.
This is a low-stress intro to fluid mechanics. You will not participate in this class, you will just sit there and listen. The room is dark and morbid, but the lecturer is committed to teaching you the scaling arguments of fluid mechanics.
Students with much experience in fluid mechanics may have already covered a large portion of the course.
This course is a very good, relatively low stress introduction to fluid mechanics.
You will get a fairly broad introduction to fluid dynamics. The course is well taught. The workload is moderate.
Great class - Lars delivers very clear, well-organized lectures.
This class builds very good physical intuition for fluid dynamics, and the problem sets are excellent practice.
It is a very good introduction to fluid dynamics, with enough astrophysics applications to keep things interesting. However, it is an introduction to fluid dynamics, so expect to spend most of the course discussing more mundane (but fundamental) topics like boats and flows around cylinders.
Good course on the basics of fluid dynamics, with fewer directly astrophysical applications than you might expect
This is a very clear course on fluid dynamics. I enjoyed lecture, but there is a surprising lack of actual astronomical applications in a course from the astronomy department.
Prof. Hernquist's clear lecturing style and intuitive grasp of the material make learning fluid dynamics approachable and interesting.
The perfect course if you want a comprehensive introduction to fluid dynamics.
Fantastic lectures that are very clear.  Homework is difficult and long, but useful.
Great course for grasping a basic understanding of fluid dynamics and its analytical methods. Expect gruelling problem sets which, for a course whose evaluation is entirely problem set-based, is not wholly unjustified. Besides being a wonderful lecturer, Lars is incredibly accessible and perfectly congenial.
