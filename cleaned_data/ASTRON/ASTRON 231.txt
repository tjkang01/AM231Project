Most practical and useful course I have taken at Harvard.
This is an excellent grad-level course. Very casual but possesses all of the information you need to supplement your research. Highly recommended.
If you want to hear Andy talk about his experiences in the field of instrumentation for a semester, take this course. This is not meant to be snarky - it was actually really great.
