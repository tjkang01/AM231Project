If you get a chance to do a 91r, and have an area of research you're really interested in pursuing, do it! It's a great opportunity and one not many people get.
91r is a great opportunity to pursue a topic you're interested in and get credit for it (as opposed to getting paid for it). Every experience is unique, but I would highly encourage anyone interested to check it out.
I am so glad that a course like this exists in the Astrophysics department. I've had an intense interest in the history of science for years, which I've fed with outside reading, but there was never really a history of science course at Harvard tailored to understanding the scientific practices of astronomy and astrophysics. This course allowed me to pursue my interest and impacted the way I view and practice science.
A great way to get credit for the research you're doing!
