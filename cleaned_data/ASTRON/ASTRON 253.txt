This is a really great course! Nick and Cranmer of both fantastic lecturer (with opposite style but they work well together). You'll leave about some very exciting plasma phenomena. The final project gives you a chance to delve deeply into something that you are interested in.
I learned so much from taking this class! It covered so many topics that are not in typical astrophysics curriculums.
A good class, especially to review a lot of E&M and learn what many astrophysicists probably don't know!
If you're interested in astrophysical plasmas, take the course!  Xuening and Nick are both extremely clear and organized, and you will learn a lot.
Take it if you are interested in plasma astrophysics. Otherwise the learning curve can be a bit abrupt. That being said, plasma astrophysics is an amazing field!
A lot of topics are covered and the homework tends to be very difficult
