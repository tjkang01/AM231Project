Take this class! This class is a seminar like class. Each week we are asked to read a paper and in class the first half is lecture while the second half is the discussion on the paper. For homework, we are asked to write critiques and future developments of the paper. The topics are really interesting and Kreiman picked a really good selection of the paper. The workload is not too much too. It is a lighthearted seminar class that you can learn a lot from!
