A great class! Learning about neurogenesis is fascinating!
Great opportunity to learn about adult neurogenesis (which is fascinating), in a very relaxed environment with a great teacher!
This is a wonderful course to take if you are interested in neural stem cells and the role that they play in the brain.  I feel like I really learned about stem cells, and the current research that is being done to see how these cells can be used to treat different ailments and diseases.  You will also be able to learn how to read scientific papers very easily and extract the important information.  Professor Magnotti is wonderful!
Great class!  Laura is awesome, and the work is totally manageable - really just reading two (sometimes kind of tough but usually fine) papers per week and then answering a bunch of questions about them.
It's the best of the tutorials. I have not been disappointed at all. I think it's slightly more work than half of a half-course, but that means you learn a lot. Excellent prep for MCB 110 or 115
The scientific articles are challenging but if you give yourself time to read through them and think critically, they are very interesting and teach you a lot.
Definitely take this tutorial if you can! The material is super interesting and up to date. Stem cells are a fascinating field to study. Laura's also great. If you have her as an advisor, you already know she's really nice, and she's an excellent lecturer.
