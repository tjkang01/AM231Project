Spend the $50 and buy Glantz. It helped me understand the concepts during the class and I'm sure it will help me in the future.
They cover important statistical tests, so you'll at least have a reference point when you encounter problems in your research that require statistics.  However, I think the course could be a little more to the point in that they spend a fair amount of time trying to explain where the equations come from, when all we really want to know is how and when to use them.
Very useful class.  You will learn a lot.
good for basic intro to statistics and also some introduction to use of MATLAB
Great class to take if you need an introduction to MATLAB or stats, or if you want to improve on these areas.
