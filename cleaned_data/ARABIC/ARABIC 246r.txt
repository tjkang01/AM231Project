Professor Granara is fantastic! The course really gives you an understanding of the Muslim West and Muslim Sicily. The materials discuss beautiful history, and the seminar is always exciting!
Professor engaging and entertaining and course material is rarely dry.  Highly recommended.
Interesting readings from a fascinating period and culture in Islamic history. Prof. Granara is lively and brings out what is interesting in the readings.
