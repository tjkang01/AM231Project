This Arabic reading course will introduce you to the study of hadith from a number of important angles. Professor Laher is extremely knowledgeable of the subject, and he does an admirable job of making the intimidatingly vast "world of hadith" accessible to students.
This seminar was a great experience with Suheil Laher. I heard great things about the previous teacher and about Laher, and he did not disappoint. Most grads and some undergrads present. Interesting survey-level material on hadith and it's history.
Even if your focus isn't hadith, the course is an outstanding chance to work through primary source texts with a wonderful instructor and expert in hadith.
If you're command of Arabic is already advanced, this class is an excellent opportunity to force yourself to engage with advanced Arabic texts many hours a week. Be ready to do most of the work on your own. That is, to sit for hours alone with the text and two or three dictionaries on the side. If don't like that prospect, don't take the course. On the other hand, it is the best possible training for working with pre-modern Arabic primary sources, with the best possible instructor to provide it.
Professor El-Rouayheb is both an excellent Arabic teacher and an excellent teacher of analyzing historical content. Write down every word he says.
You will thoroughly enjoy this course - prepare to put your Arabic to the test! A great informative course.
You should have at least three years of Arabic or the equivalent and be familiar with classical grammar.
This a great course for anyone interested in intellectual and educational history.
