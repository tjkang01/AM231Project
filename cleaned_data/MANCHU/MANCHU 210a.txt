Do it!
Despite its informal name: "Manchu Docs", this is not in fact a Manchu version of Qing Docs. The goals of the course are somewhat nebulous, readings are mostly relatively boring bibliographical essays, and the class often felt a bit directionless. That said, if you want to spend some time working on a Manchu related research topic, this class would be a good space to do so. It is also a chance to really start working with Manchu materials at Harvard, and so is worth doing on those grounds.
Fantastic course! you do not need advanced Manchu to take that class; you should take it if your are interested in knowing about what kind of Manchu sources are out there, and reflecting on how different material can be used for research.
