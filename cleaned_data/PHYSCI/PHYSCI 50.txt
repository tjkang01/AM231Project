The class was two students, but it was amazing. Take this class. There's really no other class like this out there right now. I decided to enroll because I wanted to learn CS, but I didn't want to have to deal with CS50. Not only was I able to learn more than I had expected, but each week's problem set was driven towards a goal. I made my own solar system, screened for molecules to be used in solar cells, modeled a system of particles and created a titration machine that employed a machine learning algorithm to calculate the pH of an unknown solution. The sky is the limit with this class - the more you want to learn, the more you're going to learn. (Also, there should be a promo video for this class by the time you read this. Check it out!)
People should definitely take this course! The course staff does such an amazing job of making the material feel useful and applicable to those interested in science. Coding is not easy, but the structuring of the class makes it easy to answer any questions immediately. As a premed, I really enjoyed this class as an interesting science elective.
