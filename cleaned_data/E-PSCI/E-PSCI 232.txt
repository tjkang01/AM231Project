The homework assignments are good practice of the material, and Brian does an excellent job of explaining the course material from basic physical principles.  Brian is also very generous with his time and willing to discuss students' questions until they are resolved.
Definitely worth taking for those in the atmospheric sciences.
If you are interested in meteorology or atmospheric dynamics then this is the class to take to get started. Be ready for some serious calculus and algebraic manipulation, but a good physics background will serve you well.
