It`s great for training the thinking of elemental cycles in a global scale
Excellent survey, but not enough concrete work. Too easy to gloss over readings and not fully digest the material.
I loved this class, but the schedule is intense and Dan expects that all the reading (often dozens of pages) is done before class and will ask directed questions about it.
