This class was so refreshing from an undergraduate perspective- you finally have a chance to truly explore a topic in all the depth that you don't have time for in a typical undergrad class. The papers were interesting and the discussions even more so. This class has inspired me.
I would certainly recommend this class to other structural geologists and tectonicists, but not to a general audience.
