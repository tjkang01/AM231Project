Definitely a good introduction to geochemistry, especially for students not in the field.
It is a great introduction to biogeochemistry that is well taught and doable.
This class is not so much about chemistry as it is about environmental science. If you think you are interested in environmental science it is a great course to take because it surveys many different topics and is therefore a good way to figure out which part of environmental science you are interested in. Sujoy and Dave are both great lecturers and the problem sets are pretty fun.
Interesting, fun class.  Discusses relevant, real life topics.
I would recommend this class because of its extremely interesting and relevant subject matter.
A difficult class, with topics applicable to a wide range of scientific disciplines.
take if you're interested.
If youre are interested in the environment or like chemistry.
Taking this class will make you want to be a Planeteer.
This is the best EPS class I have taken so far. It is interesting, well organized, the instructors are fun and comprehensible. The material is applicable to the real world and current events. It is not too difficult, and it is fun to learn about this stuff.
The material in the class is very interesting and brings up a lot of relevant issues.
really not an EPS course
Overall, a great course if you are interested in botany or anything plant related.
