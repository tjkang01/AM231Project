Professor Rice knows his stuff. You will learn a ton from this class, but might be confused occasionally by  complicated derivations.
This is a modeling course--lots of quantitative questions about hydrology. It does a great job of teaching the material, has really interesting labs, and is all around an good experience.
loved this class!!
