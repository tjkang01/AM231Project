Jerry is hilarious and it's a fun course especially for non-geophysicists to get exposed to topics they might not encounter in their other earth science courses. Very low work requirement.
Jerry is a great lecturer and the slides are well-prepared. A great course for anyone wanting to encounter geophysics if they haven't done so before.
Jerry is a very competent and energetic lecturer.  He is very good at balancing information and enjoyment so that you can digest a lot of information easily.  I know a number of people attended the class simply because the lecturers were so enjoyable.
Class itself was fun, Jerry is a humorous lecturer. However, the homework was frustrating and confusing.  If you don't have a background in geosciences or geophysics, I would recommend that you avoid this class.
This class is enjoyable for people with all levels of geophysics background. If you have little to no background, you will learn a lot!
Perfect course for an introduction to Geophysics. The class is entertaining!
This was probably the best course I've taken at Harvard.  The material was fascinating, and there was a great deal of it.  The math was not that difficult, and Jerry was knowledgeable and hilarious, and very interested in brushing the big questions of the field.  This was a great class as a broad yet meaningful introduction into geophysics.
Jerry is hilarious, and I learned a lot.
Very cool intro to Geophysics. Professor is engaging and entertaining, a fun class to sit in on, and it helps that its interesting too!
