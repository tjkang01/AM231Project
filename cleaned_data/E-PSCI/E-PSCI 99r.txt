I was concerned about writing such a long paper, which turned out not to be a main concern, so this should not cause people to hesitate.  I think the thesis process is frustrating at times, and probably won't go according to plan, but it was a really good experience for me nonetheless.
You get a great sense of accomplishment from completing a senior thesis. Be prepared to put in a lot of hard work, but it is worthwhile!
