The climate dynamics course is a good broad introduction to a variety of phenomena observed (or possibly observed) in the climate system, with a fun dynamical systems component, and a strong emphasis on box models of various types.
The class was time consuming but very worthwhile.
This class was really fun.  I loved Eli's teaching style and I learned a lot.  The homework always took more time to complete than I expected.
Instructor is amazing. Materials are interesting and relevant. The whole experience is a blast!
Both Eli and Nathan were great and always available to answer questions. Eli taught a very broad choice of materials covered and over all it was a great and very well taught class.
Take this class because Eli is probably the best teacher in SEAS.
Eli is a great teacher and covers interesting material in this course.
Challenging but rewarding if you put a lot of work into it. The course material is great. Homeworks take time.
This course takes a critical look at many common climate models and teaches you to distinguish between models that do and do not explain phenomena.
Never give up!
A wonderful survey of problems and avenues of solution to problems in climate. The range of problems tackled is exciting and the techniques are related but varied. Excellent course.
