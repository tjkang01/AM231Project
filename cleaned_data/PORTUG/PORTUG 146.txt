You are in for a treat! Most fascinating class you will take.
This is a great class and Professor Robbins is so friendly and helpful.  I highly recommend any of his classes.
This course is highly recommended for the quality of the syllabus and for the overall persona of Dylon Robbins, who is not only a skilled lecturer but also a very cunning reader of his student's work.
This course is so amazingly interesting that I am still thinking about the readings and the films we saw.
