It was at times difficult to understand how discussions connected to the broader theme of the course. But Prof. Nicolau is fantastic, knowledgeable, and truly cares about teaching. This is a fun class.
Professor Sevcenko's lectures are really amazing. He does a good job of explaining a variety of phenomena related to the course, and the readings/other materials are extremely interesting as well. I highly recommend this course.
know what tropicalismo is and be interested in artistic movements and historical contexts.
This is a great class about an exciting time-period when artists, thinkers and writers were trying to think outside the main modes of cultural and social production of the time. You study exciting artists, thinkers, writer, film-director.
It's not a traditional course.  The professor basically speaks for 2 hours with minimal participation.  Not to say it is boring, there are in fact some very interesting topics we study.  There is very little structure though and barely any required work except for the final paper.  Worth taking if you're interested in Brazilian culture or the cultural movements of this century at all.  Nicolau knows a lot.
Students should expect more class discussions focused on visual arts than literature per se.
