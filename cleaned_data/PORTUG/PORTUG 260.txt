I loved this class. Even though two-hour seminars can be challenging in terms of gathering our attention and keeping us engaged, Nicolau does a great job to provide interesting historical materials as well as artistic works to analyze and think critically about. Participation made all the difference in contributing to each other's understanding of the topic.
