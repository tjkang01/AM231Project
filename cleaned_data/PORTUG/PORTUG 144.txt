This course was extremely interesting, but a bit ambitious in what it tried to cover. I enjoyed learning about the history of the world (and its dominant/reactionary waves of thought), but I sometimes thought we could have focused a lot more on participating and contributing as a class to our interpretations of the work.
This class was a bit disorganized and I wasn't always sure of where we were going. The final paper presented a chance to really research and write about something from the course that I found interesting, and that aspect of the class was really great.
