I would recommend it but only if someone is serious about Portuguese and especially if they are not afraid to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. If someone were very shy I would probably recommend with reservation, but if not then with enthusiasm.
Clemenc is amazing and you'll fall in love with the class. The readings are extremely interesting and the professor goes out of her way to make you feel comfortable and supported.
This class is so fun. Don't take this class if you hate plays and theater, but I highly recommend it for anyone who is even remotely interested. You must be comfortable with group discussion (in Portuguese...don't worry you don't have to be fluent, just fairly proficient). This class is easy, but you really do learn a lot. You think, you discuss, you make it what you want. Clemence is amazing! She treats you as if you were her child. She's patient, understanding, funny and brilliant.
