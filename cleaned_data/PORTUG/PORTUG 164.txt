On the first day: do not be put off by the professor's seemingly boring demeanor. You will quickly find he is enormously entertaining and surprisingly engaging. Also, there's very* little reading. Even if you have no interest in urbanism, this course will get you excited about historical and political questions while tremendously improving your Portuguese comprehension and formal vocabulary.
The course material is fascinating, but for students to truly get the most out of the experience, this class will have to be better organized, and more discussion oriented.
Students should expect to learn a lot about the role of architecture and plastic arts in the understanding of Brazilian culture.
