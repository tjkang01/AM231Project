The class serves as a great introduction to some of the most famous Urdu poets and lines of poetry. It fosters a real sense of community and students are respected as scholars with something interesting to contribute. There are lots of different levels of Urdu fluency which can make it a bit tricky, but that's the case with most Hindi/Urdu classes here.
I would highly recommend this class. You'll learn a lot about ghazals, especially in the classical period (i.e. Mir and Ghalib, Atish, Sauda). The Urdu is pretty manageable if you're willing to do a lot of dictionary searching.
You'll come away with some spiffy memorized shers of ghazals and a much broader understanding of the ghazal's context sociologically and historically. And Amy is a terrific professor.
Urdu poetry constitutes a literary tradition of stunning beauty and great intellectual depth. This course is a fun yet comprehensive introduction to its history and the work of some of its greatest exponents.
If you like Urdu poetry you will enjoy this class.
Great emphasis on a specific poetry form. Perfect for those with an interest in the ghazal specifically!
