This course was a great introduction to Chinese literature! The readings were well structured and organized into chronological and thematic units, and the lectures were very insightful despite how short each class was.
This is a great class. Professor Tian is one of the foremost scholars of Chinese Literature and she does a great job imparting some of that wisdom. The class does cover a lot of material, but in one sense that's a good thing because it allows you to make a lot of connections. You will get out of this class what you make of it, though: the readings are very reasonable, and the amount you participate is entirely up to you.
Wonderful class. Professor Tian is such an interesting, thoughtful, and sensitive individual. Can't think of a better class on Chinese literature. Take it.
