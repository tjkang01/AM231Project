You'll have to read and talk a lot, but it's interesting and instructive!
that the syllabus was very good. highly recommended esp for comp lit students
This course is a great place to learn, to experiment with new ideas, and to share thoughts with fellow students.  The reading load is heavy though and combined with weekly responses, it takes a lot of time to prepare.  I think the work is more than worthwhile, but you should make sure you have the time to spend on it when you plan your semester.
This course provides an important perspective on the development of modern Chinese literary studies in the U.S. It is really important for students working in the field of modern Chinese studies, or even modern East Asian studies at large.
It'd be better to go into this course being already familiar with Western theorists and literary history. This is a state-of-the-field survey, not a history of modern Chinese literature, so there was less focus on the original literary texts.
