I would highly recommend this course to anyone who is interested in modern Chinese literature, for a different perspective on the subject.
Be prepared to sit down and read. Some weeks will be light, otherwise will be heavy. Check the syllabus and balance your reading load so it doesn't take you by surprise.
A window into (literally) a whole other world of Chinese literature. Asks difficult questions about identity, language, and history.
This is definitely not an introductory class, but Professor Wang makes the material fun and engaging. Do come to every class prepared though.
Syllabus. Very relevant to current research.
