This course is unique in that it goes in depth but it is still accessible. If you make time to do the readings, you will get a lot out of this course. Professor Li is very thoughtful and caring toward her students.
Take this class!! The novel is such a foundational work in Chinese literature and the class really does it justice. The class is relatively low workload but make sure to keep up with the assigned sections of the book every week because it makes the discussions (which are very engaging) even more fascinating. It made a wonderful elective because doing the reading was super enjoyable and made for productive ways to take breaks from other classes too.
