It's a great way to learn about autoimmunity and the most recent questions in the field.
It was a well don course, though it is very much an immunology course, and the approach is almost completely from an immunology stance, not pharmacological or biochemical.
nice exploration of autoimmunity and the literature.  not as much discussion as there could be, but that may potentially change and would make the class even better.
This course provides an in-dept perspective regarding the fundamental principles of autoimmunity.
