This is an awesome course if you're in any field. It really does a good job preparing students from different backgrounds and there is a good vibe of collaboration and anyone can speak up with ideas.
This is an interesting class and field and you will get to hear talks from many researchers in the field. However, the paper discussions were not very useful since the papers that were selected were not necessarily great papers. If you only know either neuroscience or immunology some of the terminology may be confusing but you should still be able to follow most of the lectures.
