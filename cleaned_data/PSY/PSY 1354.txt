Some of the readings are interesting, and the overall theme of recovering lost papers was a fascinating new idea, but overall discussions did not do very much to enhance the readings.
Just do a good job reading the papers and thinking about why they are historically important.
Interesting and engaging class in a small seminar format. If you do not like to participate with the professor present, then you probably shouldn't take this
If a student has the relevant background and interest, then I recommend this class very highly!  However, it may not be for everyone.
This course is great b/c the workload is light, and the material is pretty interesting.
It's a little more technical than any other psychology courses I took in 4 years at Harvard, be prepared for more brain-oriented discussion.
