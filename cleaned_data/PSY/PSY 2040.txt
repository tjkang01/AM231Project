Develop your reading skills... it's too hard to read every page with your busy schedule, so pick your battles, use some skimming skills, pick up a speed reading book (I used Triple Your Reading Speed to good (not triple, gosh) effect).Ask about those characters! And by characters I mean prominent researchers... Rich has character stories for all of them. Plus in all seriousness, learning about how researchers conduct themselves and relate to each other is important, and there are no better and certainly no more fun ways to do it than this.
Your work in this class will prepare you as a fledgling psychologist -- prioritize it accordingly.
All clinical psychology students are required to take this course, but it is an engaging, interesting, and useful course that I would recommend even if it were not required.
This is the best course I've taken thus far as a graduate student.
I would tell other students to be prepared to spend a LOT of time on this class and at times - at the expense of other classes and research commitments (first or second year project included).
I highly recommend this course to all clinical students
This course will truly prepare you for the big questions in the field.  It's an awesome opportunity to get to know both classic and contemporary thoughts about mental illness, all through discussion with your peers and colleagues.
