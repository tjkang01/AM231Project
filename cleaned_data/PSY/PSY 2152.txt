Susan Carey and Elizabeth Spelke are pioneers in this field and they do a great job of organizing a lecture/discussion hybrid class. The reading and assignments were reasonable, and unlike many of the other classes I've taken in the department, the faculty clearly read all the student response papers in preparation for class and gave students feedback every week.
