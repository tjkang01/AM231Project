Does not meet its goal of teaching us how to teach. The best way to learn to teach is to actually teach. When we did come in with problems, TF would just give opinion based on her experience, which I often disagreed with.
Give a lot of feedback to your peers! It will help improve your TFing, also.
This course can be helpful for teaching your sections, though the quality of feedback and ability for you to improve will likely depend on who is teaching/TFing the course.  Ours was very helpful!
They should be aware that it is required; most of the students in the class were taken quite unawares by both its existence and the amount of work required.
This is a crucial class to take during the first year of TFing.
I would definitely say this class was well worth the time, and I wouldn't recommend teaching without having taken it.
If being taught by Regan, then I would "recommend with enthusiasm"
As long as Regan is teaching, this class is awesome and very helpful!
It is required. If it weren't required, I would recommend filming a section through the Bok center, and forming a small discussion group with other new TFs.
You actually learn a lot!
You have to take it, so try to have some fun with it. I didn't always and thus it often ended up being a slog -_-
If you come to this class with a positive attitude, you will get more out of it. If you want more support, check out the Bok Center.
