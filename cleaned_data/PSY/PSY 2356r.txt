This is a great class!  Professor Nakayama is wonderful, and the Vision Lab staff is very productive but also kind, welcoming, and easy going.
It was very easy and interesting, except it was difficult to follow almost all of the lab meetings
Working in the Vision Lab is an amazing experience! The people are nice, the research they do is interesting, and lab meetings are fun and chill. If you are looking to work in a neuroscience lab, definitely consider this one!
Working in the Vision Lab is a wonderful experience...the people are warm and welcoming, but also know how to get down to business. It's a very specific area of psychology research though, so make sure you're interested. Overall, a great course!
This is a great class if you are interested in research, but you've never conducted research before.
It's a great class -- the people at the vision lab are some of the friendliest I've ever met!
If you have a project ready to work on, this is a great class to be able to devote full 10 to 15 hours a week to the project and be in lab immersed in the culture. Don't expect a lot of hand-holding - this is a very self-guided class and you should have an idea of what you are going to do and set to accomplish before you start it.
