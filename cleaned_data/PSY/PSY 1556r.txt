If you have the opportunity to work in the Banaji lab, you should absolutely take it. Olivia is incredible - brilliant, supportive, accessible, and understanding, she'll push you to think more deeply both about your own work and issues in social psychology and the world. The lab's research is fascinating and it's really a privilege to learn about and contribute to it.
I worked with Olivia and she was awesome! The project we were working on allowed us to pick what kind of work we were most interested in, so it was really great to get to explore personal interests within the context of a larger project. It felt wonderful to work on something that could have "real-life" impact.
There can be a lot of work asked of you, but you learn a lot about research for psychology!
Professor Banaji and her staff are really excellent. My supervisor spent an immense amount of time helping me become acquainted with the lab and psychology research in general. There was also a ton of freedom in the topics I could research for the lab, but I was given advice whenever I asked for it.
The Banaji lab is a great place to get lab experience for psychology and working here is a good way to decide if research is where you want to go in the field.
Your enjoyment of the course really depends on the grad-student or post-doc with whom you work. I think the topics covered in the lab are extremely interesting.
