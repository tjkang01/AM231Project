If you are looking for a thorough understanding of the psychology of racism and prejudice, you will definitely gain that from this course.
Initially, I thought the course was a general survey of race-related issues and topics in recent history (i.e. over past 20 years). However, it is very much more of a theoretical course where you are asking questions about the structure of racism theories rather than discussing the broader importance or influences of those studies in their context. It's a great course for students who like to think really deeply about psychology theory, though it may be more geared towards a graduate student type of course than an undergraduate so there are those precautions. Otherwise, Jim is incredibly intelligent and pushes you to reap the most from the class!
