An incredible opportunity to learn from two great professors at once.
Highly interesting class with a very fair workload and amazing professors- 100% recommend!
Very interesting! Not exciting, per se, but a fascinating topic and a great way to learn more about it.
Take this class! You get to sit around with two of the most prestigious memory researchers of the day and discuss both their work and memory research in general. Even if you don't think you are all that interested in psychology, this is a great elective, as memory is someone that pretty much everyone has experience with and is interested in talking about. It will also change your conception of memory and how we function as people.
A great class but what you learn is not via lecture but instead by what you read and discuss. So to get a great deal out of this class which you will, you will need to do the readings and do them in full (most often they aren't too long. Just 4 pieces of literature per week).
Two leading professors in the field leading a course that is highly collaborative and emphasizes deeper thinking/ discussion.
