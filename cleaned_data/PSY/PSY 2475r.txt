12 hours a week, need to be highly self-motivated
Working in the Systems Neuroscience of Psychopathology lab was a great experience, and a wonderful way to get hands-on research experience as part of one's coursework. I would highly recommend it!
Everyone in the lab is chill
The actual focus of the lab is very interesting; the lab itself is new and rather unstructured, still in the works. Very hands-off in terms of assignments given in the lab. Allows a lot of flexibility in terms of project undertaken in lab  you have some leverage in what project you want to participate in, as an assistant or thesis researcher. Josh knows his stuff, very clear explainer of concepts. Very busy, not very accessible, unfortunately  its quite a big let-down. Youll see very little of him throughout the semester, except at lab meetings. Lab meetings once weekly are helpful in getting an idea of what else is going on in lab. Hayley, the lab organizer, is sweet and flexible; if you cant come in, let her know in advance.Requires 10-15 hours in lab per week  you have to be physically present, which doesnt feel very useful when youre doing a project which is computer-based. (Perhaps you could get more done at home.) I guess this is what research assistants are supposed to be, but we really were more like mice-servants than project leaders much of the time. There are a lot of us, and a lot of data input, and little explanation as to the overall scope and purpose of our work. If youre doing a group project and someone slacks (because people arent kept accountable), youll pick up their work.
This is a great lab course. Professor Buckholtz is working on really interesting stuff, and the grad students in the lab are all very smart and insightful.
Definitely join this lab if you can!
Buckholtz and his team are dope. You can't go wrong with them.
