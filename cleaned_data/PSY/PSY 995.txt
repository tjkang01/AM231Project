This was one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. While I usually don't like research classes, I found this class to be amazing. Professor Elinor engaged us in very stimulating discussion around the topics, and guided us naturally through the research process. It was a wonderful way to end my psych experience, especially given the diversity of the topics. Definitely recommend to students not writing a thesis!
TAKE THIS CLASS!!!! It's so incredible, especially if the class is small. Professor Amit is so knowledgeable and accessible, which makes for a great semester. It felt more of a psych/life course than strictly a psych course!
