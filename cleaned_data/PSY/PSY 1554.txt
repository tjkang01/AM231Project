Take it - olivia is kind of tough but its a great course overral and you learn a lot of important stuff.
This course is a lot of work and has a pretty strict set of policies in terms of sickness, late assignments, etc. Unless synchrony is a passion of yours it is likely more than the actual amount learned is worth.
This class was WONDERFUL. If you're interested in learning about how we sync up with other people, it's definitely the class for you. It gives you a lot of things to think about.
This class is perfect for people interesting in social connection and understanding your own everyday encounters...very helpful!
This class was amazingly interesting and super relevant to everyday  life. How we relate to and connect with people is such a real-world topic. That is why I love psychology. Prof. Kang is able to create the perfect balance between lecturing and leading a discussion. She is very passionate about the material, and there is no one I would have rather learned this subject from. She is also just a really cool person!
This course focuses on the role in synchrony in social behavior.  It covers physical, physiological, and neural synchrony before delving into the broader implications of synchrony for social behavior.  The workload is very manageable, with a few papers to read for each week and a response paper.  Some of the response papers felt like busy work, since we were required to do a literature search and propose discussion questions separately from the main response paper.  The papers were usually fairly interesting, though there were weeks when they did not seem to go together (possibly because this was the first time this course was taught).
