You will be fascinated.
The atmosphere of the course is open and exploratory, and Professor Langer brings enthusiasm and energy to the meetings. I would recommend coming in with an idea for something you would like to study or with a general willingness to help on other people's study in mindfulness-related research.
If you're interested in Dr. Langer's mindfulness research, go for it! Just be aware that your priority will be to run participants in existing studies, not to design a study yourself. The lab meetings are great - lots of interesting discussions.
This is a lab class - you must want to participate in running subjects, writing proposals and managing an experiment (if possible).
Great opportunity to work one on one with professionals in the field and to contribute to valuable research that could provide a means for change in society
