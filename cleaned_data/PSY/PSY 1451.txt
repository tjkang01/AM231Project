Sam is awesome, and this class generated so many interesting discussions with minimal work outside of readings. It will be hard to get a lot out of this class without a strong background in neuroscience and psychology, and some mathematical maturity though.
This is the greatest class I have taken at Harvard. Professor Gershman is one of the smartest people I have ever met, and he challenges you to think critically about your own ideas and the ideas of others. The discussion format was wonderful because it forced us to dig deep and think critically about the materials we were given, often leading to such a better understanding of the disorders and theories discussed than a lecture. I cannot recommend this course enough for anyone interested in modeling disorders.
This is a rare opportunity to study the grounding theories of cognition.
This class is awesome if you want to learn about how computational methods have been used to model psychiatric conditions. The entire course is all about reading and discussing papers, so it's important that you actually read all the papers throughly and are prepared to participate in discussions.
Sam is great, take it!
