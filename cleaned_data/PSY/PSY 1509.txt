I absolutely loved this class!  The instructor, Nicole, is very supportive and really cares about each student learning and getting their hands dirty on this subject.  She is also super organized, which makes for an evenly-paced, consistent class.  If you have any interest in this subject at all, I highly recommend you take it.  I can genuinely say I looked forward to this class every week.
The content of the class is interesting and the coursework required for is reasonable and straightforward. The readings are monotonous at times.
This course is a lot of fun and really gets you thinking.  It taught me a lot about myself as well.
It's a relaxed but engaging course that leads to a new perspective on oneself and others after every class.
Very applicable to daily life! You learn a lot about yourself and how others perceive themselves. Not hard.
