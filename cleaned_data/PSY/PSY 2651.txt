This seminar is an amazing way to learn about the cognitive abilities that make humans unique. The subject matter sounds very specific, but I really think it's a useful way to understand the roots of a lot of fascinating human social dynamics, like cooperation and culture especially.
The course is a great elective in psychology, especially if you are interested in social cognition and comparing work with humans and non-human primates.  Though our class was small, we had a great group which led to really interesting discussions each week.  The workload is manageable.
Maybe the best class I've taken at Harvard. Definitely one to take if you're a junior or senior who wants to explore this topic at a much deeper level than you might get in other classesI felt like I was accountable for my work in a way that led me to really grow, but without ever feeling like I was in over my head. Also Felix is just a wonderful personA+ class, definitely consider taking it if you feel like you're up for more of a challenge.
this course covered a lot of different questions in a deep manner, the discussions were fast-paced and the professor facilitated them well, the students were all very engaged, and the topics covered were fascinating and there were many questions that were left open though still very much explored; definitely worth taking
look at the syllabus. it the content interests you, take it.
