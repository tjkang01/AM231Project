it's an interesting course with a great instructor. and he's funny. that's always a bonus.
Figure out your *big* questions about psychotherapy. Then ask and ye shall receive a lot of great answers... and questions.
As an undergraduate, one can take a variety of courses about psychopathology generally, but what isn't usually addressed is psychotherapy. This class - if you're lucky enough to be able to enroll - fills that gap in quite nicely. Psychotherapy is a much more controversial and challenging area of clinical psychology than I originally thought. Prof. Nock does a wonderful job of moving the course along in a variety of directions that all tie in together in one way or another. If you're seriously considering doing psychotherapeutic research or do some sort of clinical work in the future, then I highly recommend this course!
One of the best courses I've taken at Harvard - literally revolutionized how I think about research. If you're interested in clinical psych and have some experience with treatment principles, you'll really enjoy this class.
This course will teach you tons about the strengths and limitations of psychological treatment research, and provide useful avenues for independent future explorations.
you will learn so much
You will learn an immense amount about treatment research and have the opportunity to hear from acclaimed scholars who have shaped the field.
