I highly recommend this course for anyone with an interest in the neuroanatomical underpinnings of human social behavior.  The studies covered in this course address many of the most important questions in this field.  Prof. Cikara is a superb instructor.  Her feedback towards the end of the course was the most useful I have ever received for a final project at Harvard.  She was extremely accessible and went out of her way to find resources for students (including emailing a paper that was relevant to my project on Thanksgiving Day!).  The workload is definitely manageable, and class discussions were often quite interesting.
This was an awesome class. Professor Cikara leads a semi-structured discussion that gets everyone participating. She is very supportive and open to answering students' questions, whether that be about the week's readings or other previous or existing studies. Time feels like it goes by quickly.
