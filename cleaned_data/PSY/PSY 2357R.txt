great lab with great people and flexible hours!
It's a good class and the lab is extremely friendly. Professor Krasnow is sweet, and you are surrounded by great ideas.
The Krazlab is an awesome environment to experience psychological research firsthand. The faculty and grad students are really helpful in helping you understand difficult concepts and find which areas of evolutionary psychology truly interest you.
