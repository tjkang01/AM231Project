Given that you're required to take a testing class, I think Marla is one of the better profs you could have.
If taught with more organization and thoughtfulness around assignments - this could be fantastic. I think this is a key part of training for a program that leads to clinical licensure.
This is an extremely comprehensive overview of psychological tests that also gives you experience in administering and scoring the tests.
This class requires a huge time commitment that is not equivalent to the amount material we did/must learn. Time spent in the class room and on assignment should be cut in half.
