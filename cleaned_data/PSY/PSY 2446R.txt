Dr. Hooley is great! Send her an email (she always responds in a timely manner!) if you're passionate about Clinical Psych.
The Hooley Lab is wonderfully welcoming to undergrads and happy to involve them in lab meetings and discussions.  I felt welcome and learned quite a bit about the process of psychological research.
If you're looking to get experience in clinical psych research, this is as good as it gets! You will get to know super smart, impressive, yet humble people and do really important work.
It's definitely good to get experience in a lab such as this one. Professor Hooley and the grad students are all FANTASTIC people. Really nice and very knowledgeable. However, check to see what kind of work you'll be doing. If you don't like data entry and all that you'll be doing is data entry, you might to rethink what lab you join.
