Take this as a first-year grad student if at all possible. You will learn incredibly useful and applicable lessons to carry with you as you embark on your own research and clinical relationships. Really wonderful class!
This course is incredibly interesting if the students are actively engaged in the discussion of the presented material. Jill does a great job of guiding the discussion and bringing in examples from her own experiences.
This is an excellent class that is extremely useful for clinical psychologists in training.
The class is interesting and challenges you to think about issues in research, teaching, and clinical work from an ethical standpoint.  The class is beneficial professional, but also develops and fosters important skills in thinking about problems from an ethical perspective.
