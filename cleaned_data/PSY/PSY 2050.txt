A great elective class for anyone truly interested in the specifics of the history of psychology. All articles are understandable without a background in psych. or statistics.
the professor is amazing! really knowledgeable
Despite the fact that some of the material is dry and the course has a pretty odd structure (the only assignments were outlines about every other week and one take home final, and no feedback is given throughout the semester), this class was a welcome breath of fresh air from other psychology classes at Harvard. Prof. McNally is animated and extremely knowledgeable, and the class is very low-stress, low-pressure. Great class.
This course was fun and interesting...there was a lot of chance for interaction as well.
This course is a low stress class, and Professor McNally is an excellent instructor.  Future students should be prepared that most of the readings are primary sources, which is welcome.
The knowledge learned from the material and from Professor McNally is substantial.
Professor McNally is very knowledgeable and will make you laugh.
Though there isn't much feedback throughout the semester (one paper in the end, some presentations) the course is easygoing. Prof. McNally is quite an amazing and entertaining lecturer--so I'd highly recommend it!
The best class I've taken in the psych department, and Professor McNally is a fantastic lecturer. Minimal work. Topics that everyone in psychology should know more about. Take this class!
You will gain a thorough understanding of important developments in the history of psychology in the last 150 years.
Read the textbook even though it isn't assigned reading! The professor is great and the topic will be interesting to anyone in the field. I think it would be weird to be awarded a PhD in psychology without this fundamental knowledge of the field.
