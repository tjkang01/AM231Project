You will learn how to develop and implement methods for changing target behaviors. Through this class, you will establish tools for yourself as an individual and as a therapist that will likely stick with you forever. You will grow as a person throughout the semester and finish the class feeling empowered.
Do the readings! They contain important material that is not necessarily covered in class.
Devise your self-change project wisely! Don't shy away from difficult areas, and choose something important to you. This helps you get far more out of the experience, both personally and educationally.
Excellent class. No one will check up on whether you have done the readings but they are all interesting and important and I would recommend doing them.
Really great class -- wish it was a full year.
It's a really great class, particularly if you're interested in clinical work. It's a wonderful forum for discussing CBT and other issues that arise during therapy.
