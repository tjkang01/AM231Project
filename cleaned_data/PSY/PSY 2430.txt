I really enjoyed this class.  It provides a wonderful overview of how social identity intersects with health care and clinical practice.  I learned about unique challenges different groups face as well as the work that clinical scientists have done to think about how to support people in each group.  I really enjoyed the quality of the readings, the group discussions, and individual presentations.
Take it - you will become more sensitive and knowledgeable about the real issues of diversity and how they impact us as scientists and clinicians
Take this course to understand the limitation and possibility of clinical psychology and psychotherapy.
It is an amazing course which provides you with a lot knowledge concerning cultural diversity topics in the field of clinical psychology and professor Nock is excellent to teach the course.
This is a specific approach to the topic, that of cultural and individual diversity in psychotherapy. It is strictly focused on the empirical findings and in that sense falls in line with Harvard's psychology department as a whole. However, as the topic could still be approached in a variety of ways, with a variety of methods, it is important to understand that this class will, for the most part, take ONE, and only one, approach to the topic at hand.
