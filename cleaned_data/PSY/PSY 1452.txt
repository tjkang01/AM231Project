This is a phenomenal course. It seems like it's rather specific but you actually gain knowledge that far exceeds the understanding of how faces and decisions based on faces influence our lives. There is actually a fair deal of neuroscience involved if you are interested, while covering about everything that could ever be related to faces from psychological perspective. The extra plus is that for final paper you can literally do whatever you want, and there will be so many topics you will want to choose from - from the influences faces have on our daily life to how else we might be encoding different types of stimuli in certain parts of the brain. Really enjoyed it!
I highly recommend this course to anyone interested in psychology.  Although some of the lectures and readings are highly technical (for those just starting in field), Professor Nakayama and Sam are always available to meet with you for additional help.
Professor Nakayama and Sam are absolutely wonderful people who will take it upon themselves to ensure that you get something out of this class. They care more about you actually learning something than tedious, busywork assignments/grades like you often see in such psych seminars, and you will get to participate in great, thought-provoking discussions every week about top-of-the-field research. I honestly really enjoyed this class more than I expected to at the beginning, and if it is offered again, I would definitely recommend it.
very focused course, obviously you should only be considering this if you find the face (and how we process it) fascinating.
It is fun and not too much work.
Great course!  The professor is amazing: knows his stuff but is really down-to-earth and approachable.  It seems like such a specific topic, but you'll be surprised how applicable the information in this course is to such widespread areas of research.
