It's a great small course. Work with your classmates and professor to tailor the course to your needs and learning style.
Take advantage of V. Dibrova! Class taught by this writer offers amazing insight into the language and culture.
take this class if you want to learn ukrainian, but be forewarned the course is quite fast-paced, so stay on top of the material
Professor Dibrova is a really wonderful instructor. he focuses more on the essence of the language rather than grammatical specificities, and he makes the material really interesting. interesting enough to get up for 9 am class.
