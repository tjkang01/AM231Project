It's a requirement, so you have to take it, but there have been worse required classes.
If you are looking for a basic introduction into types of clinical trials this is a good class for you.
read the literature required - the papers are fun to read, and enlightening.
It's a fun course, but you don't learn so much in it.
Interesting and laid-back course that teaches you how to think about translational medicine. Has a very different feel from other classes, which was nice.
It's a great way to understand case studies and the process of clinical trials.
good overview of how a basic science discovery moves through translational work, through clinical trials, and FDA approval. nice perspective from NEJM staff on rigor/levels of clinical evidence
Great course - I learned a lot and enjoyed the format.
Low course load, helpful discussion of medical statistics, an introduction to how to read medical publications like NEJM
Great for those interested in this type of research.
This quarter course provides an excellent overview of clinical trial design and evaluation. The lecturers are excellent, and the class is a low-pressure environment for learning about aspects of drug development and clinical trials.
If you're interested in translational research, I highly recommend this lecture!
