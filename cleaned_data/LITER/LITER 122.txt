This is probably the most esoteric class I have ever taken, and I LOVED it. It turns out, encyclopedism is widely applicable. At times I started viewing the entire world as encyclopedic. The way you approach the material is unlike any other class I have taken--it is both historical and philosophical. This class introduces you to beautiful (and at time, hilarious) works I would never have encountered otherwise. However, the class seemed to encourage very pretentious discussion and it can be hard to speak freely. By the end, you may be a bit tired of talking about encyclopedism, but it's a fantastic class and I definitely recommend it. Prof. Johnson is incredibly enthusiastic and excited about the material, and loves to get to know students!
This course is often conducted like a lecture. Luckily, Professor Johnson has interesting things to say about the readings, but calling it a seminar is not quite accurate.
If the subject of encyclopedism in fiction, and it's myriad applications in the form of lists, digressions, and labyrinthian texts strikes you as interesting then this is the class for you.
