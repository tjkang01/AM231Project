Don't miss an opportunity to study with Prof. Negron
You should not miss out on an opportunity to hear Luis Giron-Negron lecture on his special field. He brings light and life to the Middle Ages in an unforgettable way.
It is an excellent introductory class to much of the autobiographical material of the Middle Ages
You may not discuss all of the assigned readings, but the more you read, and the more closely you read, the more you will get out of the course.
This is a great look at medieval autobiographies from many different European cultures.  Professor Giron is so extremely intelligent, eloquent and knowledgeable, he knows probably 20 languages and loves reading the texts in their original languages, which is awesome.  There isn't much discussion in class, which isn't bad because hearing him talk and teach is extremely enlightening.  The readings a really interesting and worth doing!
This course has a fairly heavy reading-load, at least in its first part. But the texts read are really fundamental to developing one's understanding of subjectivity as a literary topic, and of medieval literature as a whole.
