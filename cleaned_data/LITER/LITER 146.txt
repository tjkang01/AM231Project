If you want fuel for thought, no matter the intellectual persuasion of your studies, take this course!
The work load is not too burdensome and the films were very thought provoking when analyzed alongside the theoretical readings.
It's difficult, because the material, especially the films, was very worthwhile. And yes, the class was easy, in that it didn't require anything of you other than two intense and unpleasant sessions for midterms and finals. But when I finally felt comfortable or interested enough to want to contribute to discussion, i did not feel bold enough to interrupt Professor Conley's lecture during our class, which is how most people get their voices heard. Despite a high percentage of the grade being based on participation, a small percentage of the class would regularly participate. The discussions were not interesting to me, and we rarely delved into the issues of space and place in films as much as we could have. Some of the reading was interesting, but I would not recommend this class simply for the feeling of lack of intention and lack of care that the teachers displayed. I did not feel concerned for as a student--and I do not mean that I prefer to be coddled, but I believe that teachers should care about and invest in students' learning, which did not feel like the case.
That there is a lot of lecture
The professor is appropriately spacey. Joke class--unless spatial theory (Baudrillard, Virilio, Zizek, etc) means something to you.
