If this course title caught your eye because you are interested in one or both of the topics, it's for you! Professor Nagy is both knowledgeable and passionate about the material, and it's a fun and low-key opportunity to discuss many forms of art and literature.
Take a class with Prof. Nagy before you graduate - I'm so glad I did!
If this class is offered again, you would be crazy not to take it. It was very interesting and enjoyable and there was basically no work at all. Also, Professor Nagy is wonderful!
To future students, do as much reading and explore every subject further than what you only discuss in class, further exploration will enlighten you.
