Professor Johnson is a fantastic teacher, and you will learn boatloads about some very great poetry.  If you appreciate beautiful language and deep, though-provoking analysis, there is a lot for you to love here.
You have to be a big, big fan of poetry, practically a nerd, because lectures will be very dull to you otherwise since they're fairly abstract and harder than something like an introductory poetry class. That being said, I'm a total poetry nerd so it was great for me!
Again, I strongly recommend this course but not if you are the kind of student who likes to focus on one author, or one historical period, etc. at a time.
You really need to enjoy poetry!
Professor Johnson is very knowledge, and brings up great points about the poets and poems.  I would have preferred a little bit more discussion in section.
