Professor Suleiman is a great teacher; she is very knowledgeable, generates a lot of enthusiasm for the material, and also facilitates discussion well.
Lots of writing and reading!
Professor Suleiman is a true Harvard gem. And this course is an excellent way to see her at her best.
Professor Suleiman totally made this class. The amount of time spent discussing the ethical, literary and historical background of the Holocaust was definitely enough to get me up to scratch and to make thoughtful comments. I enjoyed this very much, and would highly recommend this if it's offered again. It's a pity that Professor Suleiman is retiring.
This is a great course with super enriching and captivating materials. Professor Suleiman is great at facilitating class discussion and has a lot to share about the subject.
