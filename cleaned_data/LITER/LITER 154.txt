This class is wonderful, and Hamilton is one of the best and knowledgable professors I've ever met. These are the sorts of classes that define the Harvard experience. You should definitely take this class.
Wonderful class, wonderful material, wonderful professor.
This course changed the way I think about music and the voice.  It is a fascinating exploration of ideas that seem basic but are actually full of complexity.  The course draws on concepts from European, Classical, and Biblical intellectual traditions.  The readings are enjoyable and interesting, and Professor Hamilton is an amazing lecturer.
It is extremely provoking and rigorously organized.  The texts are challenging but rewarding, and Professor Hamilton is always able to explain in a clear and unassuming way.
This is the best Lit class I've taken. The readings are very interesting to anyone interested in music and literature. Professor Hamilton is brilliant and approachable. The kind workload allows you to actually do all the reading and invest in the class. I fully recommend this course.
Definitely take a class with John Hamilton if you can! He is an amazing professor. If you are interested in music, especially writings analyzing or (in the case of a lot of the fiction we read) describing music, this is the class to take.
This class is a tricky one because you have to be okay with not having much to say and with not understanding many of the readings.
Take it!
As mentioned above.
