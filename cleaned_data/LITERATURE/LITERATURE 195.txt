Karen is a wonderful teacher, and the way she connects dots between texts really adds a great deal of insight into the books on the reading list (usually everything that you have been wanting to read for a long time!)It's a great class, though discussion can sometimes get derailed. In any case, great reading materials, great professor!
This course was both challenging and rewarding, and the section discussions were among the most enlightening I have participated in at Harvard. However, the readings quickly become cumbersome, and the way your grade is determined isperhaps unfairly skewed. However, the topics you are forced to grapple with are of a very high level, which may be intimidating to some, especially those without astrong literary or philosophical background. Overall, it was a very interesting and unique course.
If you like modernist or contemporary lit, this is a great class!
