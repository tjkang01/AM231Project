There is no way to do all the readings thoroughly because there's so much of it. They don't always seem related, either. Though section was great, lecture wasn't all that interesting because it never seemed directly relevant to what was discussed in section, or even to the readings for that week. The films are great, and the papers always have interesting prompts, but the lectures are definitely not a high point.
You learn a great deal about urban architecture in film/literature!
The syllabus contains an amazing assortment of readings and films that develop the central themes well. Unfortunately, the lectures just can't keep up: after the first few, they just sort of drop off (bad presentation, lack of analysis/organization). If you're interested in these themes and texts, I would say take the course just to discuss them in section (which I found excellent) with the knowledge that lectures are not worth attending.
This is probably my favorite class I have taken at Harvard. It will expose you to a really awesome selection of urban theory, as well as to fascinating art and films. The class is really well-organized and each week is cohesive and different, encapsulating a different means of "imagining" urban space each week. The readings are tough: really interesting, but theoretical, complex and tricky to understand. Lectures are really interesting and the professors are very eloquent and also entertaining. Overall a really awesome course.
Be ready to read. A lot.
