Enthusiastic professor, unique opportunity for truly creative work. A course not to be missed.
This is a unique class that will structure itself differently each time it runs based on the interests of those enrolled. It is a truly extraordinary chance to be inspired by the ideas of classmates and to make comparative connections that might seem outlandish or extreme in other contexts.
This course will change your life! An amazing opportunity to casually discuss interesting topics with a highly engaged and knowledgeable professor.
This class has helped me "connect dots" in many ways, and I found it inspiring to hear Professor Nagy bringing in so many materials to class from various disciplines and different time periods which somehow are all connected to one other.
