I love the African Language Program. The classes are tiny, the material is fascinating and the instructors are often really cool. My experience in Gky was admittedly atypical: I study linguistics, and because Prof. Mgane is a linguist I was able to use linguistic knowledge to learn much more quickly and effectively. Nevertheless, my case is a good example of how, in a small class, the curriculum can be adapted to precisely fit the needs of the student.
I have not by any means taken a normal set of courses in my time at Harvard, but this class stands out anyway. As with most African language classes, the material is fascinating, the classes are small and the curriculum can be adjusted to precisely fit the needs of the student. As with most African language classes, textbooks are lacking and there is an unstructured feel, meaning that a motivated student can make it something really memorable--but an unmotivated student might not get quite as much out of it. As for me, well, it was great: I learned a lot about the language, talked about linguistics with the professor and found a thesis topic. I guess I would honestly "recommend with reservations" given the above caveats, but I have to say "recommend with enthusiasm" to make sure it gets 5 stars as one of the most memorable classes I have taken here!
