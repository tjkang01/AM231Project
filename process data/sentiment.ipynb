      "I did not particularly enjoy this course, but it is necessary for Life Sciences concentrations and a pre-med track so you have to take it.\n",
      "I would avoid this class if at all possible.  It was horrible and took up all of my time this semester.\n",
      "Don't take this class if you can possibly help it.  It is quite possibly the worst class I have ever taken and have hated every minute of it.  The lectures are boring, the practice problems do not help that much for exams, the exams are long and hard, and the lab portion is deplorable.  Worst of all, you will have write a Genetic Disorder Project that is truly a waste of time.  Unless you really want to be a geneticist, I would say stay away from LS 1b.\n",
      "Do not take this class. Change concentrations if you must. The worst class I've ever taken.\n",
      "This class has a reputation for being a terrible class, but it is not true. However, I would only recommend it if it is a requirement.\n",
      "It's still a new class and it's not quite organized yet.  It can be overly confusing.  The preceptors and TFs and professors are all working on it, so maybe it will be better in the future.  It sort of frustrated me a lot though, and if you're not pre-med I wouldn't take it.\n",
      "Please save yourself the pain of this course. It is absolutely terrible. Only take it if it's a requirement, otherwise stay away, please!\n",
      "It's a lot of work and not very organized.\n",
      "The class is difficult and takes a lot of time, but you will come out with a thorough understanding of genetics and evolution.\n",
      "It is the worst class I have taken at Harvard thus far.\n",
      "Worse class you can take as a freshman. Almost as bad as expository writing.\n",
      "While you learn a lot from the class, a lot is expected of you.\n",
      "The material is interesting and makes the class worthwhile, in spite of the sometimes boring lecturing and the pointless assignments.\n",
      "I would tell students to be prepared for a class that (unfortunately) takes fascinating material and breaks it down into boring and dry components, presented in an unclear manner.\n",
      "Tough class but worth it\n",
      "Don't do the readings unless you have trouble with the concepts. Attending lecture without coffee, gum, and a friend to kick you is unwise.\n",
      "The class will help you in further science concentrations at Harvard even though the subject matter isn't inherent in the specific concentration you are looking at.\n",
      "It is pretty poorly organized and sections are not very helpful.\n",
      "The grading in this course is difficult.\n",
      "Just by doing all the psets and studying claculuation, you'll probably only get a C avergae on the tests. In order to do well in this course, you must entirely focus on REALLY UNDERSTANDING the conceptual aspects of the science behind what is taught. That part is really difficult considering what is taught in lecture and section is the MINIMAL knowledge you need, but not enough to apply it unless you're some super genius.\n",
      "The labs are endless, boring, and irrelevant.  The lectures are good, although you have to teach yourself a lot of the material on your own.\n",
      "Learn to do the problems. That's all you actually need to know how to do, all of the other knowledge is sort of optional.\n",
      "The course feels unorganized and the lectures are hard to follow.\n",
      "Be ready for some independent research to clear up concepts that were explained poorly.\n",
      "worst class ever taken at harvard.\n",
      "I would tell them that basically everything other than the practice problems was completely pointless.\n",
      "This course is a somewhat basic and flawed introduction to genetics.  Only take this if you really want to learn about genetics or its a concentration requirement.\n",
      "Some very interesting material--but tons of work and often boring lectures.\n",
      "GDP is useless.  The textbook is sort of useless as well.\n",
      "LS1b is a class you should take only if you truly love biology, because the large lecture size and uncomfortable seating in Sanders Theatre makes it hard to stay awake and take notes.\n",
      "This has been the worst experience of my life.\n",
      "While the class can be annoying, you do actually learn a lot and much of it is useful. Do the practice problems!!\n",
      "This class is not as boring in lectures as LS 1a, but it is still an impersonal, massive intro science class. The topics are varied and not too difficult, but don't take it unless you have to for a concentration. It will not help you appreciate life sciences.\n",
      "I'm sorry you have to take this class. Maybe, by the time you have to take it, they would have actually listened to the course evaluations and done something about how painful this class is.\n",
      "The material is necessary to learn, but at times painfully acquired.\n",
      "Hit or miss - if you keep up, it's not really that bad at all.\n",
      "IMPORTANT!!! If you're not planning on concentrating in the life science you do NOT have to take this class for pre-med requirements. There are other options! This is a terrible class.\n",
      "If the professors who teach the course change or they change their style of teaching, then the class would be much better. The actual material isn't what makes this class boring - it's the way in which the material is presented!\n",
      "Only take this course if you have to. And take it conjunction with PS1, so you can kill two very painful birds with one stone.\n",
      "This is not a very good class; try to take another biology class if you need it for a premedical requirement.\n",
      "This class is all about your commitment. The information is boring, and you really have to teach it to yourself if you want to do well. That being said, you can do well if you are willing to do it all yourself.\n",
      "This course sucks (not because of the materials but because of the humdrum professors, who tests their students unfairly) but you have to take it anyway if you are concentrating in Life Science subjects.\n",
      "A lot of information is covered in this course in a short period of time, and the multiple choice/short answer components of exams are very difficult.  This course also requires a lot of different types of work - there are weekly problem sets, midterm exams, two short papers, a group presentation, quizzes, lab reports, a final paper, and a final exam.  The lectures often cover material too quickly and can sometimes be very boring.\n",
      "I didn't really enjoy it, but it wasn't terrible. Just never really clicked.\n",
      "This class is a neessity for many concentrations but it very difficult to get through.\n",
      "The lectures in the first half of the semester before evolution are not very interesting, but it is important to keep up. If you do end up falling asleep, try to rewatch the videos. Doing practice problems are also a great way to study for midterms. The multiple choice on the midterms are dangerous though, as they are 5 points each, and they usually test on random information briefly discussed in class.\n",
      "The lectures are not very interesting but section can be helpful\n",
      "Many people believe that this course is poorly taught, but I disagree. The lectures are interesting and explanations are understandable. The big problem with the class is that it is poorly organized. Questions on midterms and problem sets are often ambiguous, meaning that your grade relies on your ability to read the mind of the preceptors as well as mastery of the course material. The GDP project is highly regarded by the preceptors and they use it as one of the major selling points of the class. I found it thoroughly frustrating because it involves trawling through paper after paper looking for scraps of information. The amount learned from this project is too small for the amount of time that it takes.If at all possible try to stay away from this course!\n",
      "You need to take it at the right time so you can ignore the typical freshmen grumblings about the class, which are really annoying and unjustified.\n",
      "Run! As fast as you can if you do not have to take this course. The only reason I would suggest this course is if you are pre-med or if this is a concentration requirement or if you really, really like genetics. This has to be the worst, uninteresting class I have take at Harvard. The work is tedious, the lectures are boring, and the professors do not make this a worthwhile class. If you are a decent student and you care, you will get through this class. It's not so difficult and most of the concepts are common sense. However, it becomes increasingly hard to care about this class as the semester wanes. Also, if you take this exam, study for the final exam, hard! Your final exam can make or break your grade.\n",
      "Just take it.  But don't expect great things -- in fact, it's terrible.  If you don't know anything about biology, you'll find it very hard.  If you know a lot about biology, take it as an easy class.\n",
      "It is a lot of tedious work.\n",
      "An incredibly unpleasant course. You'll need to devout so much time for it. Each week, you will have to work on its PSETs, GDP-related stuff, lab reports AND prepare for lab quizzes. Simply too annoying.\n",
      "The lectures are boring, the practice problems are a lot like the midterms (they throw wrenches into the actual midterms though), and the class is not my favorite\n",
      "Pre-meds will probably have to take it. Everyone else: avoid it at all costs! I honestly hated it.\n",
      "Try to find a way to NOT take this course, because it was possibly the worst course I have taken here. It was consistently unorganized, boring and repetitive, and yet required a lot of work.\n",
      "The lecturers are not as bad as many people make it out to be.\n",
      "Its a necessary evil.\n",
      "Its not a great course, but for the number of courses that require it, its not that bad (its better than expos).\n",
      "be prepared to be bored\n",
      "If you don't do every single practice problem every week, you will really fall behind.\n",
      "terrible terrible terrible you think life science 1a is bad, this is worse\n",
      "Just bear with it, a lot of things could be worse in your life.\n",
      "Be prepared; it's not a joy to take this course. It's hard to stay on top of things, and the material is often boring and difficult.\n",
      "The concepts taught in lecture usually require reading over multiple times; sections and office hours are very helpful\n",
      "Lectures are boring. Prepare.\n",
      "This class is not fun and it will constantly give you grief, but every once in a while they mention something mildly interesting and relevant to everyday life\n",
      "Even if you loved Lifesci 1a like me, you will still hate Lifesci 1b. Don't be fooled. Or hopeful.\n",
      "Be prepared to do a lot of busy work for the class.  Definitely go to the preceptor's or Head TF's office hours and try to do each week as lectures and the book are often unclear.  If you can identify and troubleshoot problems that are difficult for you from the beginning of the course, you'll have a much easier time preparing for the final.\n",
      "Do not take this class. If you're thinking of being pre-med, try to find some way around taking this class. LifeSci 1b is the worst course I have ever taken, and if you have any respect for yourself and your sanity at all, you will not enroll in this course. It sets a new standard and performs as a paradigm for exactly how dreadful a class can possibly be.\n",
      "Interesting material, but very badly organized and covers a lot, so you have to work hard to understand how everything fits together\n",
      "The lectures are boring. Your experience really depends on your TF. I had a fantastic TF while other people hated the course because their TFs were pretty bad...\n",
      "Life Sciences 1b definitely has its ups and downs. On one hand, the concepts can be very engaging if one is thoroughly interested in the subject, but it can be tedious to do certain unnamed projects throughout the course. It can also be difficult to grasp concepts with a syllabus that seems to involve a lot of skipping around with only vague established connections between concepts.\n",
      "DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS IN THE SAME SEMESTER AS PS1!!!! The lifesci 1b exam occured the day after the PS1 exam not only once, but twice! The scheduling of this classes assignments and exams were never convenient and hardly ever seem to be thought out to take into account the PS1 assignments, even though they were aware that half of the students in lifesci 1B also took PS1.\n",
      "I mean, you have to take this class for almost any life sciences class. You don't have a choice. I would not take this class for my Science of Living Systems gen ed, though, if I had a chocie.\n",
      "This course just doesn't work. The information could be interesting, but the way it is taught is disjointed, confusing, and not good. In the end, you'll learn a lot, but its not fun while you're going through it.\n",
      "Interesting subject matter, only take the class if you are truly interested in the subject, otherwise material will seem boring and you will slack off.\n",
      "It's nothing like LS1a, but the professors mean well and the resurrection policy gives you the opportunity to do well.\n",
      "Only take this class under two conditions: pre-med requirement and/or concentration requirement. Only take this class after you are ABSOLUTELY positive that you fulfill one of those conditions. If not, there are much better science classes that aren't as convoluted, boring and demanding.\n",

      "Come to class and pay attention, do the redbook, and study everything, even those useless details because they will be on the midterms.\n",
      "This class is going to be very boring and will not challenge you. The problem sets are spoon-fed to you by the PSL's. Tiny details count just as much as the broader portions of the course, which really serves as a detriment.\n",
      "This course is something you have to take, probably not something you want to. You are treated like a high-school student: incessant clicker questions, quizzes, boring material... There is no continuity in this course, and even in the lectures themselves. If you want to learn about genetics, I'd be much happier recommending you to go to the library, for there you will be able to learn without being bothered by the grading trivialities of this class.\n",

      "It is a difficult course to take with PS1\n",
      "horrible lectures, but you need to make the most of it. read the material, do the practice problems, and work hard.\n",
      "It's not fun and the exams are hard. Try to keep up with practice problems and readings because if you fall behind it sucks.\n",
      "This is probably one of the worst classes at Harvard.  Only take it if you absolutely have to (which, because of concentration and premed requirements, you probably do).  You can try to game it, but don't expect to learn much, despite the interesting subject matter of genetics.\n",
      "it'll make your life miserable and hope that something terrible happens in evolution so nobody else will ever have to take this class.\n",
      "This is the type of class where if you get behind on the reading or problem sets, it is very difficult to catch up. There is a lot of memorization required but you will learn all the basics of genetics and evolution.\n",
      "The lectures were not very helpful at all, and all the learning takes place in section.\n",

      "This class is necessary if you are planning to be a pre-med.  That being said, after having taken this class, I have decided to continue on the pre-med track but to not concentrate in any type of science.  If this class is any indication of what other science classes are like, then I could never put myself through four years of misery.  Take advantage of the extra credit opportunities, because you will need them.  The class is set up in such a way that no matter how hard you try, you end up needing a curve or scale in order to receive an acceptable grade.\n",
      "It's boring, difficult, not at all interesting, but necessary if you want to go into medicine\n",
      "The class itself isn't so bad, the work doesn't take up too much time (although GDP had mixed reviews on its worth), but wary of the exams because if you don't prepare well it can be much more difficult than you expected.\n",

      "Ls1b is focused on problem solving and the quantitative aspects of genetics, which is actually really interesting. Otherwise, the class is terrible. It is a a relatively easy pre-med requirement, though. Lectures are a great way to catch up on sleep, the Genetic Disorder Project (GDP) is by far the worst assignment you'll ever do at Harvard, and no partial credit is awarded on exams.\n",
      "It is very badly organized. The readings are not too helpful. You don learn a lot though.\n",
      "It is sad that you may be required to take this course, cause it is not a reflection of what your concentration will be like. I have met few people who can honestly say they enjoyed the course. The material is interesting, but the course itself is terrible.\n",
      "The class is not particularly difficult, but that doesn't mean that it will necessarily be painless.  The Genetic Disorder Project will always be lying in wait behind all of the other work in the class, with the deadline looming in the distance.  In addition, the lectures are hard to stay focused on.  They are not the most entertaining events, and a typical sleep-deprived college student may have trouble remaining awake and alert.  The bottom line, though, is that the course does teach some valuable information about genetics (and statistics, though stats isn't part of the course title).  If you are pre-med, this is a required course and shouldn't harm your GPA.\n",

      "I have known many people tho have become disenfranchised from the sciences in general because of this class in coordination with LS1a. This does not have to happen to you! Unfortunately, this class is a requirement for nearly everything. So suck it up, grit your teeth, and put a decent amount of effort into this class and it won't be too bad.\n",
      "IT IS TOUGH!! the red book is very helpful! Go to your tf's office hours.\n",
      "Many people will take this course because it is required for pre-med. therefore, I will not say don't take the course. However, I will warn you that you are going to have to work extremely hard to teach yourself the material because lectures can be confusing and sections can be confusing as well.\n",
      "This course is tough and there's not much help unless you ASK for it. Do problems, get extra help.\n",
      "Don't do it. Lectures are uninspiring and the class will drain you of your sanity. Lectures are read straight from the slides, the book does a horrible job of explaining concepts, and it will leave you insanely frustrated. However, the psets are super easy.\n",

      "you will be bored out of your mind. but it doesn't take up much time.\n",
      "The exams are the worst part of this course. A large portion of your grade is not based on conceptual understanding, but rather memorization of random facts.\n",
      "This class is full of busy work and is a complete waste of time. Everyone in the class is taking it to move on to real life science classes in sophomore year. The lectures are boring, and Prof. Ruvolo literally reads straight off the slides. People are there to do the clicker questions, but you can learn just as much without going to class. The GDP is a pain, and sections are horribly boring.\n",
      "This class will introduce you to the basics of genetics in a pain-free way. Lectures are a little boring sometimes, but easy to follow. If you go to section and really learn how to do the practice problems, there's no way to do poorly in this class.\n",
      "The material is very difficult and it requires a lot of personal time and effort outside of class to teach yourself the material.\n",
      "This class sucks\n",
      "Be serious about science if you take this course.  This course is the first stage in weeding out the pre-meds & science majors from those who aren't serious.  If you only want to do science in college as a hobby, this is not the course for you.\n",
      "The course is not great, but it isn't as horrible as the Q guide comments say in the previous years. It's a little less good than Life Sciences 1a, and the professors are much less engaging. Still, the material is interesting, and you shouldn't skip the course just because it is rated poorly; go for it, and all will be fine.\n",
      "Your red book is your bible and basically the course is a disaster so do not feel bad.\n",
      "Very boring\n",
      "LS1b tries too hard to make the students like it, and in doing so fails not only to be a good course but to generate student interest. Lecture slides are silly and cluttered, lecture time is wasted on silly activities, and it is nearly impossible to know what is actually expected of you. The class has a plethora of assignments, with numerous things due on any one date, and it's nearly impossible to keep track of all the moving parts. Finally, the class wastes time on silly activities and to compensate breezes through important concepts, making it hard to know what to do.LS1b is 70% Fraternity 30% Biology, the class needs to take itself seriously, don't expect this to be a well structured or very intellectual experience.\n",
      "If you're considering the class at all, you probably have to take it for a biology concentration or premed requirement, so you'll have to just grin and bear it. It will be manageable, but very frustrating along the way. Be prepared to seek out information independently from TFs and PSLs, because there is a large disconnect between what is emphasized in lecture and what will show up on p-sets and exams.\n",
      "It's not bad, it's just hard!\n",
      "You'll take this class because you have to. However, it is bad. Long labs, obnoxious psets, and boring lectures.\n",
      "The material is hard but definitely manageable - don't hesitate to use resources. Lectures sometimes may be unhelpful at times - need/desirable to go to office hours\n",
      "People made this class out to be the worst and super hard. But luckily, they did a massive rehaul, so the course is taught by knowledgeable professors. The tests are hard, but hey if you're premed, at least it's good practice for Orgo.\n",
      "The bad news is, this class - for lack of a more polite way to say this - really sucks. The even worse news is, you probably have to take it if you're thinking about doing anything remotely related to science, or premed. So it's really like an inescapable evil. The professors are great, brilliant minds, don't get me wrong- I felt lucky to have sat in on their lectures about some truly interesting phenomena. That said though, the course is just so disorganized and I often had no clue what to hone in on as far as exams. The lab component is also terrible; there was always so much actual section material to cover, that all the steps for the actual lab work just get annoying and uninteresting. I've never felt so frustrated with a class before. I really hope that they improve this class for future years.\n",
      "This course is bad. BAD. The material is so interesting but it's ruined by the horribly made psets and exam questions, the poor organization of the course, and the wording of the questions that constantly cost people points even when they know the material very well. I'm LIVID with this class because it casts such a horrible image on science courses at Harvard, and it makes me very worried about future courses I'll take. TAKE THIS CLASS WITH CAUTION.\n",
      "I think that its easy info, but their grading is just harsh and outside graders are annoying. The information is really interesting, though.\n",
      "Poorly organized and poorly taught\n",

      "The class is frustrating at times but is taught well.\n",
      "Be prepared to work hard and still be confused sometimes--there is a lot of material to chew through and not a lot of time to do it based on the pace of the class. But none of the material is super difficult. All of it makes sense; you just have to do a lot of wading through information to isolate what is important.\n",
      "This class throws a lot of information at you at once. In addition, questions and tests are phrased in very complicated and convoluted ways that sometimes left me unable to tell what answer they wanted or how in depth I was meant to respond. Something that will help is reviewing the lecture slides and readings before class. The readings weren't always helpful, but sometimes they helped explain the more difficult concepts.\n",
      "You'll either like it a lot or hate it.\n",
      "This class is very difficult, but I found it to be well-run.  I definitely feel that it does not deserve the horrible reputation that is has.  The subject material was really interesting, the professors were interesting, and the assignments were fair.\n",
      "If you have to take this class, I am sorry. It has so much potential, the material is fascinating. They just try to fit in too much information into lecture, then different information in section, with confusing p-sets. Not all of the professor are comprehensible, and some of the lecture teaching-methods are very questionable (mostly confusing). I loved the material, hated the class\n",
      "This class really isn't as bad as everybody says. Just do your work and keep up with the lecture material. The psets are straightforward and the tests doable. Take this class if you're interested in genetics or thinking about being a bio concentrator.\n",
      "If you get a good TF then I think your experience will be compltetly different than mine. Also, go to problem solving lectures. They may seem annoying becuase they are an extra lecture but they basically tell you how to do pset problems and are extremely useful when the time to study for the exam comes. The class itself hardly covers how to do problems that are on psets and exams.\n",
      "It's hard, especially if you're not good at biology. It's even harder if you have an awful TF, which I did. (apparently there's a lot of bad TFs...)With that said, the professors are awesome and the material is really interesting. You cover a ton of material though, and it's hard to stay up with it. So even though I probably didn't do that well I the class, I'm glad I took it. As a class, it has improved from prior years, but it still has a long way to go...\n",
      "Problem sets can really ask unspecific or vague questions.\n",
      "Get through it for pre-med or bio fields, otherwise steer clear, it's not worth the stress.\n",
      "make sure to go to office hours and really understand everything you're doing or else the exams will be terrible!\n",
      "The exams were hard.  They were extremely nit-picky and sometimes the grading was unfair and unbalanced.  The course material is really interesting, but the lectures are very disorganized.\n",
      "Difficult but you learn a lot\n",
      "Psets are difficult, not as fulfilling as ls1a in my opinion, or as forgiving.\n",
      "A little disorganized, which made me uneasy, but not so bad at its core.\n",
      "you will learn a lot, but the material is not taught extremely well\n",
      "The exams are graded really hard.\n",
      "It's really not that bad.  I had the impression it'd be worse; expect a pretty normal class.\n",
      "Your experience in this class is entirely dependent on your TF, and I unfortunately had a really incompetent TF who wasn't an effective teacher and a really harsh grader that returned assignments late (we got our first lab back on the last week of class). There's a terrible amount of busywork in this class - sometimes, there are two problem sets due a week along with lab writeups and other random things. The material can be interesting, but the disorganization of the class can make learning tough. Some of the questions written on the homework's/exams are vaguely phrased and thus, difficult to answer and do well on. Going to the PSL sessions really made the course bearable, but even then, the PSLs don't have all the answers.\n",
      "I hated this class, and I really don't mean to exaggerate. It was unreasonably difficult, and I often left section or lecture feeling so dumb and as if there was no way for me to get help. I think that major improvements need to be made to this class in order for it to be enjoyable by any means.\n",
      "You are probably a pre-med (props to those of you who aren't and are still going through this hell... though I wonder if you are completely sane..) and you are going to have to take this class. And Harvard knows it. Try all they might to get interesting lecturers, the class as a whole is ambiguous and no amount of studying can help if you are just bad at understanding the questions. That was my biggest failure in the class. I did understand the material, just not what LS1b wanted me to answer. That is not how a class should be.\n",
      "The class is on an upward trend.  Q-scores from years past may be misleading.\n",
      "It's a tough class but the changes made over the years are starting to pay off and its not a particularly bad experience.\n",
      "This is a class plagued with problems. Whatever reason you may have to take this class. Don't. I'm a  junior and this was by far the worst class that I have taken at Harvard. PSets have terrible grading schemes to them, exams are not representative of the course, lectures are poorly given, and (mandatory) section is the biggest waste of time. Test out of it, take other classes, do whatever you have to do. Don't take LS1b.\n",
      "Premed Course Alert: genetics is interesting, but the course is all about fighting daily for your grade with chores and silly assignments. Never was there a truly hard problem to think about.\n",
      "It's a gateway course.  I might as well recommend it.  Plus, it's bad!  It's mostly on the student to be an active learner. This is how she learns!\n",
      "The class is better than it was in the past. However, I was still miserable because even though I slave away at assignments like psets, papers, and labs, in the end the exams are the only thing worth anything. No matter how well you do in any other portion of the class, there is absolutely no safety net should you do poorly on your exams.\n",
      "Don't be afraid of this class but also be prepared to be annoyed with some organizational issues.  Overall, the material and labs are interesting, but the professors vary in teaching strength.\n",
      "LS1B is notorious for being a horrible class, but it has gotten exponentially better over the past two years. The content is extraordinary (albeit confusing at times), and the class is actually very well-organized. Be ready to work hard, but it is definitely worth taking.\n",
      "I took it for a requirement dreading it but it's not as bad as people say it is.  Some of the lectures were pretty dry but a lot were really interesting.  That being said, I wouldn't recommend it unless you need it.\n",
      "Did not like the LS series overall, however this class is very well organized. Even though the subject matter was not really cohesive you do come out of it getting a big sense of the world of genetics. If I could I would have chosen to taken LS2 or the MCB series over it.\n",
      "The p sets are fun, but the tests are annoying.... Be prepared to answer questions about nitty gritty details\n",
      "This was a horrible class.\n",
      "Professor Barry's lecture slides are kind of useless and Mary Ellen was pretty boring to listen to. Although all the professors generate enthusiasm for the course, it is impossible to do the problem sets without going to the Friday help sessions. These help session should not be optional!!! They are absolutely necessary to just have a basic idea of what is going on in the course. Also, the readings are not that helpful. To prepare for exams, you really need to do all the practice problems.\n",
      "This will probably be the worst class you will take at Harvard, and you don't even get a medal when you're done with it.\n",
      "This class is near the worst class you'll ever take at Harvard. Sorry pre-meds. At least it's getting better...\n",
      "I waited a year to see if LS1b would be \"fixed\" after its unfortunate reputation in past years, and I would say that it definitely has been.  All 3 lecturers were outstanding, and the course covered a vast amount of material while maintaining a very manageable workload. Don't let the midterms catch you off guard though, or it can be painful.  Work hard, do practice problems, and you won't regret taking this class.\n",
      "Hard class but interesting. Seems like a lot of random topics.\n",
      "very difficult\n",
      "It's quite amazing how pathetic a course at Harvard can ever be.First of all, my complaint is not out of trying to justify doing badly in a class.  I scored well above 90 in the quiz and the two midterms.  For me the class was very easy; I spent maximum 1.5 hours outside of class for this.Everything you learn in this course will be vague, ambiguous, confusing, and ill-defined.  The Psets are not enlightening but confusing.  They will present you with a concept but never actually explain it well.  Part of the reason is that the course tries to present simplified versions of these concepts, and then fails at it.  Sometimes with oversimplification comes more confusion and even wrong information.  The reasoning for the answers on psets or exams are absolutely ridiculous too; the only reason I did well was because I knew how to play games.  I considered the entire course as a game; when they mention certain words, you just use certain words and phrases to answer it.  There is no thinking nor understanding of the concepts involved.  When I asked them a question \"that reasoning does not work because it assumes this and this, and the assumption is not a valid one either.  How can it yield the right answer then?\" The answer was along the line of \"yes, you are right. but our answer could be the case too.  So we'll just accept ours as the answer and not yours.\" Great. Amazing reasoning that is.Now, I do concede that I'm being a little unfair since this is really their first year teaching this course, but unless they really take time to change many aspects of the course, I can tell you that you will very likely go through what I went through.  That is, you'll come to Harvard as a biology passionate person, and by the end of the course, you'll be disgusted by it so much that you consider switching into government major.They really don't care about the course anyway.  After the first quiz, which I did very well on, I in fact sent them an email on how the course could become better.  I wrote 600 words, in detail and with specificity, how the lectures can become more helpful.  They sent an email back saying they'll take my comments into account.  The lectures got only worse.Lastly, I guarantee you that this comment will not make it to the Q-guide, although it is one of the accurate ones, but I'll share with many people on FB and email so that you will receive the right information.  I'm not complaining because of a bad grade, nor because I'm having a hard time with the course.  I'm just severely disappointed at how absolutely miserable a Harvard course can be, and I just wanted to let you know about it.\n",
      "Prepare to work extremely hard outside of class.\n",
      "This course remains flawed, but probably better than past iterations.\n",
      "Very interesting material but terrible TF.\n",
      "You're going to take it, because you have to, but you're going to have a bad time.\n",
      "it's not terrible. do not procrastinate studying and study all of the random/vague notes. know the concepts--don't just do practice problems. compared to other years it's apparently better. berry and hoekstra are amazing. ruvolo is boring and turned me off of HEB forever. what you learn is pretty interesting, but the statistics part (heritability, etc.) seemed really pointless and was incredibly boring.\n",
      "This class is very hard and the material covered in lectures is not exactly portrayed in the homework and tests. This made it feel that going to lecture is  a waste of time since what they tested on was on the optional Friday discussions.\n",
      "There's no way of telling what's going to be on the exam, so study everything, and expect to be disappointed.\n",
      "The exams are extremely difficult.\n",
      "It was extremely difficult and hard to learn the material.\n",
      "It takes worknot hard per say, but the details can get annoying if you aren't particularly enthused.\n",
      "Take it because you have to. It's not great at all. Just get through it and work with friends to understand the material.\n",
      "This course is necessary, and sometimes boring. It is manageable if you keep up with the work.\n",
      "This class can have a lot of tedious, boring moments, but it also has sparks of really interesting material as well. This would be a good class to explore if you are thinking about the different evolutionary concentrations because all forms of evolution, from fossils, humans, plants, etc, are covered in at least some detail throughout the course.\n",
      "Only take LS1b if you have to.  It will be frustrating, and you will regret the time you spend on this class.\n",
      "This class is slightly boring at times and difficult with tests, but pretty rewarding once completed.\n",
      "This is genuinely the worst course I have ever enrolled in throughout the entirety of my academic career.  Even if this course is a concentration requirement, DO NOT take it until it gets better Q scores or there are serious course overhauls.  This course has made me reevaluate my status as a science concentrator despite having a long history in science research.\n",
      "This class is really hard and section is boring.\n",
      "Though the material is difficult, as to be expected, the lectures are engaging and the topic is well taught. Of course, this doesn't mean one can get by without doing further studying outside of class.\n",
      "Avoid if possible (horrible way to \"explore\" an interest)\n",
      "They throw a ridiculous amount of information at you in this course.  The focus is not on problem solving like ls1a, but rote memorization.  Unless you have an eidetic memory, you will have trouble with the exams.  Glad it's over...\n",
      "It's difficult to avoid this class for science concentrators, so you just have to get it over with. It wasn't a ton of work, but some of the lectures were really boring, some of the labs were pointless, and some of the psets are extremely difficult for no real reason.\n",
      "Much has improved from the past iterations of this class.\n",
      "The class is not very well organized. Perhaps wait a couple years to take it until it gets figured out. The exams are unfair. Go to problem solving lectures!!\n",
      "You have to take it, so suck it up. Even with the teaching staff, LS1B is an organizational disaster. Just get through, at least you'll be done with it in a semester.\n",
      "Pretty good course, but watch out for ruvolo, she is TERRIBLE.\n",
      "If I didn't have to take this class, I wouldn't have. The professors have drastically improved, I'm sure, yet the class is still awful at times. Be prepared to enjoy watching Andrew Berry's lectures, but then be confused as to what you actually learned in them afterwards. Be prepared to love Hopi Hoekstra's lectures because she actually explains things clearly and gives you the main idea of each slide in a red box, which really helps. Be prepared to like Dr. Ruvolo's lectures on Tuesdays and then fall asleep during dense lectures on Thursdays. Be prepared to have a terrible TF that wastes your time in section every week for three hours. Be prepared to not have enough time to finish your first midterm. Be prepared to get no partial credit on the second midterm (although this midterm wasn't bad at all, people who missed a question, missed it completely). Lastly, be prepared to be take an extremely unfair final, which will ask you questions about videos that weren't even shown in class and ask you to recreate experiments from the one lecture that literally caused half the class to go to sleep and the other half to look dazed and confused. Be prepared to take notes, so that you can destroy them in the q guide next year, unless a miracle happens and they actually listen to the advice that students give regarding the course. All in all, the topics are actually interesting, yet they make the class very annoying and a pain to be in. The professors could  do something phenomenal if they worked with the equally great preceptors to  create something that is enjoyable for students. But until then, be prepared to loathe this class.\n",
      "Better than last year. Professor Berry makes more jokes than teaches during lecture. Professor Ruvolo is dry and frankly boring. Professor Hoekstra is the one beacon of hope for this abysmal class. Also combined section and lab was extremely long and painful.\n",
      "This class is very poorly organized. If you need to take this class be prepared to dedicate time toward organizing the material in the course to learn it. Go to office hours to try to find out how the course grading truly works. I feel that this class is not conducive to learning and is more of a struggle as to how to get points rather than learning the course material.\n",
      "Grading for tests are heavily based on explaining definitions. Furthermore, these definitions are graded on a rubric, resulting in a grade that might not necessarily reflect your understanding.\n",
      "Very difficult\n",
      "This class will teach you a lot, and the material covered in lecture is extremely interesting. That being said, be aware of what you're getting yourself into. Section is excruciatingly long and normally pretty boring, the tests are hard, the GDP project is annoying, and the p-sets often are difficult. For the amount you learn in this class, it's worth it, but just barely.\n",
      "It is not as bad as it has been in past years. I actually enjoyed the class much more than I expected to.\n",
      "It was hard.\n",
      "sucks!\n",
      "You have to take it because its required for all science, but its a ton of information packed into a small amount of time, an the exams are not fair.\n",
      "Horrible but necessary class\n",
      "I only took this course because I had to. It was not very well put together.\n",
      "Not as bad as its reputation!\n",
      "This course was difficult, but fun. Or so I am told.\n",
      "This class is one of the most poorly run classes ever.  Go to friday lectures which are the only things tested on.  Lecture is a waste since they don't cover the material necessary for the exams.  But it doesn't matter because you have to take LS1b anyway...\n",
      "From what I hear, it's a lot better than it has been in the past, which is heartening. It's still not a fantastic class though, but it won't be the worst thing you've ever done.\n",
      "I would have chosen 'unlikely to recommend' if it weren't for the fact that Ls1b  is the gateway class to practically all other pre-med rec science classes.\n",
      "Just don't take this class if you don't have to. You'll seriously be miserable.\n",
      "LS1b is a tough course to organize by virtue of its material--it's hard to organize all these facts and methods in a coherent way that doesn't seem like flooding the students with useless information. The lectures, problems, practice problems, and exams do not fit too well with each other yet. While you do learn a lot in the course, it is also a lot of memorization and you will need to do a lot of the work yourself if you desire to understand these concepts. Nonetheless, the teaching staff is quite decent (I really admire Hopi for her lecturing ability!) and if you get a good TF you can really learn quite a bit. They are all dedicated to helping you understand the material--it can just seem frustrating at times because the course doesn't have a well defined/emphasized direction yet.\n",
      "It's impossible.  No matter how hard you try, no matter how may Psets you go over, no matter how many office hours you go to and whether or not you think you know the material like the back of your hand, the exams will ruin you.  Especially the final, the questions were vague, convoluted, and awkwardly written.  If you can avoid the course, I would.  If you can't, god speed.\n",
      "It is hard, the tests suck, but the information you gain is invaluable.\n",
      "Only take this course if you need to fulfill a requirement.  It is a very frustrating course, due to poor organization, problem sets and exams.\n",
      "LS1b is an experience you likely have to have for your life sciences concentration or to satisfy pre-med requirements. It's not that bad and occasionally fun, but I wouldn't recommend it as an elective.\n",
      "You have to take it because it is required, but it is awful. Just please don't make your decision about being a doctor on lifesci 1a and 1b because these courses are just bad, and it's not your fault.\n",
      "Take this course if you need it for a requirement... It's not terribly difficult but can be annoying at times.\n",
      "LS1b is a solid course for anyone looking to satisfy part of the pre-med biology requirement or just an interest in genetics in general. Although I took the course for the former reason (I have no unusually intense passion for genetics over any other science), I can still attest that it is an informative and well-run course.\n",
      "Not my favorite, but not as painful as it's been in the past.  The problem sets aren't bad, get a good TF and lab won't be painful.  If you're considering taking this class, you probably are required to so just accept the gift of Andrew and Hopi and deal with Maryellen.\n",
      "This is literally the worst class I've ever taken in my entire life, not just at Harvard. There is honestly no way to learn the material that is on the exams since it is not taught in lecture or section. I really think this class is some sort of sick joke. If you must take this class for a premed requirement, beware it will probably ruin your GPA for med school and maybe even persuade you to pursue another field. The professors are ruthless and don't care if everyone fails. The exams are literally marathons, no one finishes in time and I think this is very well reflected in the fact that the mean for the first midterm was a 70. The fact that everyone fails the class is a reflection of the inane teaching of this class and not of the students, but the professors don't seem to understand this. I honestly think the goal of this class is to crush as many premed students' aspirations as possible. Harvard should be embarrassed for offering such an ill-taught impossible class. I recommend this class to no one. Find another way to get the premed requirement as this is one of the the worst classes offered at Harvard.\n",
      "I mean it's necessary for pre-med, so I guess I would have to recommend it in that regard. I was on the fence about pre-med, and now I am not on the fence; I have plummeted from the fence and will probably crash on the comfy squishy Economics landing mat.\n",
      "It is not as bad as everyone makes it sound. The PSLs are helpful if you need a repitition of information, but they can be a bit slow.\n",
      "The lectures are large and rather uninformative with regards to problem sets/ exams. The grading is terribly specific. The course seemed unnecessarily difficult.\n",
      "I'm really sorry you will be forced to take this course as a biology concentrator or pre-med student. It really was awful. The material itself is interesting but not challenging, and problem sets and exams aren't that bad, but it is so poorly taught and organized. There are unnecessary readings every week (which I wouldn't recommend doing), pointless labs, and demanding GDP question sets, which are graded far too harshly. This is a bad course, but you'll survive.\n",
      "I would recommend this course because it is a good base for any science concentrator but for no other reason. It was really difficult.\n",
      "If you had a good AP biology course in high school, most of the first half of the course should be review, while the second half touches on some newer trends in population genetics.  However, that doesn't mean that you will do well, even if you know all of the material very well.  The questions can be asked very poorly and the grading done very unfairly.\n",
      "People say it's a terrible class. But it really isn't. It is different from Ls1a, but if you just do the things they ask of you. Do the practice exams, read the lecture notes, you can actually really enjoy it.\n",
      "The tests are really hard and Kevin's lectures are boring, but Pardis is AMAZING and the material is really cool.\n",
      "The course is rigorous, and very different from LS1a. Some elements of the grading is unfair, especially in the GDP project. The class can be occasionally time consuming. Altogether not a very enjoyable experience.\n",
      "This class is not a fun time, but you have to take it for requirements.  There's a ridiculous amount of work (if you do everything you're actually supposed to - readings, etc.) that doesn't really pay off.  Go to office hours with your TF, do the practice problems. Don't stress about the lectures themselves though.\n",
      "You take this because you have to. It's too big of a class, the labs are a pain and sometimes ineffective (pick beads out of yarn, SCIENCE), weekly GDP question sets were annoying and time consuming. But ultimately you can succeed in this class if you put in the work each week - review lectures so you're not cramming by exams, work with other people on psets, work through practice problems when you can. There's a ton of resources to help you succeed and get a tutor if you're struggling with the material. Hopi and Pardis should be the bookends of the course because their presentation and fields are most engaging.\n",
      "not as bad as people say. just do practice problems! learn to problem-solve and you will be okay\n",
      "It's a good class - it definitely isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. That being said, if you object strongly to pre-med classes (classes where people will work really hard for exams, where starting a pset the day before it's due means most people are done, etc), then it might be annoying. GDP also sucks.I loved the material, though, and thought that the course was really fun. Exams were fair, and I felt like I learned a ton. Don't be afraid of this class just because people say it's bad. If you go in telling yourself you hate it you'll hate it, but that's how life works.\n",
      "I think it is quite rare for anyone to take this class by choice, but even so the class really isn't that bad. People make it out to be awful, and it isn't. I thought all of the professors were pretty good lecturers, and there is a large support structure in place to help you learn the material.\n",
      "It is not as bad as people make it seem. If you want an A, however, be prepared to spend a lot of time working through the practice problems each night.\n",
      "This class is one of those classes that you can do well in if you put in the time or you can do average in if you do minimal work and study for exams. It's up to you.\n",
      "This class is a lot of work, and they really expect you to do all the work for this class even though this is not the only class students are taking. The genetic disorder project is annoying because of the harsh grading, and the professors' lectures can be disorganized.\n",
      "This is not a fun science class but you do learn a lot\n",
      "Skip Eggan's lectures and go to all the other ones\n",
      "It is a requirement to get out of the way, and it is not as bad as some people say!\n",
      "Only take it if you're serious in the pre-med track/genuinely interested in genetics\n",
      "Be prepared for a bad grade and a lot of work.\n",
      "It really sucks that this class is required for all biology concentrations. Just suck it up and power through, I guess.\n",
      "It is a difficult course with lectures that are not very effective. Be prepared to study on your own outside of class.\n",
      "GDP and the grading will destroy you\n",
      "The course material is interesting but at times this course could be super frustrating. The GDP was incredibly annoying and didn't really teach me much, and the last quarter of the semester (Ruvolo's section) was unclear and unengaging.\n",
      "The grading is very unfair.\n",
      "This was an awful class. The exams absolutely kill you. Lectures & materials are very interesting, but the problem solving lectures on Fridays are too long and too useless. There should be more support from the preceptors to students.\n",
      "This course is required for my pre-med requirement. The material is extremely interesting and worth learning because it is vital to understanding the importance of research and how it applies to real world problems. However, the way the course is structured is horrible. The way work is evaluated needs serious work. There are times were I know the material cold and my TF has acknowledged that fact, yet on the exam it doesn't reflect because questions are unclear or specific in a way that the wording must be familiar. I was told to simply memorize question structures over reviewing lecture notes and material and it makes the class grading confusing and unfair in my opinion. I think grading and evaluation structure needs tremendous work.\n",
      "This class is very difficult due to the GDP and the lectures being unclear. There is a lot of work and a lot of time must be put into the class. It made me realize that I didn't want to do biology due to the material. The lectures are also a bit dry. If you're not going into the sciences do not take this course.\n",
      "I really liked the content of the course. Genetics is a fascinating subject. That being said, I was extremely frustrated with the grading and feedback, and Maryellen's lectures were extremely boring.\n",
      "It is harder than LS1a, but it isn't too bad.\n",
      "LS1b is really easy. Just be willing to spend countless hours on pointless and tedious assignments.\n",
      "That it is an unfortunate experience every pre-med student must endure.\n",
      "This class is terrible, and the only reason that people ever take it is to go beyond this course.\n",
      "The material in this class is not especially challenging, but dealing with it's tedious requirements (ex. clicker questions, GDP, labs, etc) makes it so that you end up underestimating how much time you will commit to this course.\n",
      "Do not take this class, do whatever you can to avoid it. It was the worst experience I have had at Harvard.\n",
      "Quite a bit of work and on the psets/tests they are looking for very specific answers. Interesting material but the way the class is run at times can be quite frustrating. GDP project is very annoying and graded very strictly.\n",
      "It's not as bad as the sophomores say it is!\n",
      "There's a good reason why this class gets consistently low Q scores every year. It's because it's not a great class. If there's any way you can avoid taking this class and still fulfilling the same requirements (because you're definitely only taking LS1b for some pre-req or the other) do it. The material in this class is interesting for a little while because you talk about genetic engineering and stuff but also the lecturers are boring and compared to LS1a this class is very poorly organized. Also, sections actually take 3 hours almost every week and it's awful.\n",
      "Not great, but not bad for a required class.\n",
      "good class, but exams can be difficult and have vague questions. if you don't like macro-type biology (populations, migration,etc) you might not enjoy this class\n",
      "This is a class in which you will learn a lot, but the class itself is a bitch. In terms of work, you will have to review a lot to really understand the material, and to work through the psets. Attendance is MANDATORY (clicker questions), so that's something to also think about. Lecture itself is usually pretty boring and hard to follow; the lecturers are all amazing and well known in the field but have trouble translating that into good teaching;  the post-lecture notes are what will get you through this class. Section will basically be a 3 hour waste of your life, so think about that when choosing a time for section. The tests are very hard (everyone fails the first one (this year, the avg was 77) and then cries about it), try to do practice problems for every single lecture and start studying 1-2 weeks before.  Take advantage of Amy and Casey, the course preceptors. All-in-all, it's a class of semi-interesting material that's taught very poorly, but you will learn a lot by studying.\n",
      "It is not that bad of a course but that may be because I have a strong interest in genetics and biology. Definitely requires time to be put into the class in order to understand the concepts and succeed.\n",
      "This is a class that you pretty much have to take if you wish to further engage with the life sciences. It's not great, but it's really not that bad if you utilize the lecture slides and your TF. A course to get through that you can get a lot out of if you engage with it.\n",
      "Disorganized lecture sequence, seems to jump from topic to topic and return to things quite randomly.\n",
      "The material is really interesting but the teaching is really bad and the structure is frustrating\n",
      "I mean if you're looking at this class then you probably have to take it so just take it.\n",
      "If you like biology at all, or are a life science person, the material is really cool. Yes, the class is hard and annoying sometimes, but the material makes it worth it.\n",
      "This class covers many broad topics and seems to pick and choose information to teach rather haphazardly. You do end up learning something, but sometimes the lectures can be very unorganized and shallow.\n",
      "It's not agonizing and the content is pretty interesting, so the course doesn't really deserve as bad a reputation as it has (though perhaps it was improved this year from past years?) Focus on problem-solving, pattern recognition, and avoiding careless mistakes, and you should be fine.\n",
      "This class is flat out terrible. The lecturers are OK and the course material sometimes borders on interesting. However, the assignments, labs, and sections are a complete waste of time and just ask students to regurgitate knowledge.\n",
      "If you take it with the expectation that it'll be awful and there will be a lot of work, you'll have an awful semester because that's all you'll concentrate on. However, if you take the class looking forward to learn, I think you'll get something out of it. However, be warned that there are a lot of basic statistical tests you must learn throughout the course.\n",
      "It's harder than LS1a. Much different in experience.\n",
      "You will love some parts of it and hate others\n",
      "Seriously, if you don't have to take this course DON'T TAKE IT. Save yourself the stress,\n",
      "Only take this course if you are pre-med. It's not worth the hassle.\n",
      "GDP is awfully graded.\n",
      "Whatever happens, you're going to lose points because of some BS. Embrace it and let yourself become a smarter person because of it. Study hard and review lectures before and after class.\n",
      "This class is unorganized and rather difficult. I would not take this class unless you have to.\n",
      "Only take this class if you have to for a science concentration or for premed requirements.  The workload is pretty ridiculous and it is pretty hard to learn all the concepts.  You can get through it if you have to, but don't do it unless you have to.\n",
      "This class was the opposite of fun. The course material was actually really interesting, but, unfortunately, the professors and TFs found a way to make it dry and boring. Unfortunately, for many life sciences concentrations, this class is a requirement, so people have to take it anyway.\n",
      "This class is extremely time consuming, the lectures are difficult to apply to the problem sets, and the tests are terribly difficult. That said, some of the topics covered in lecture are pretty interesting, but I wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't a requirement.\n",
      "This course really wasn't very difficult for me but I had taken AP Bio coming in to it. The readings were very unnecessary and I did few of them if any while still maintaining a good grade in the class. The hardest part was the GDP and PSETs slamming you sunday nights.\n",
      "i.\tFrom all my friends and peers in the class that I have talked to, I get the sense that the most dissatisfying part of the course is the philosophy or attitude towards our learning. Rather than feeling encouraged to learn and being positively rewarded for our efforts, we are punished by unnecessarily strict rubrics on the GDP (which don't do anything for our learning but discourage us- when we put in effort to learn something but aren't rewarded for it because of minutia) or by no rewarding of partial credit on psets/exams (because one word is different from what was written on the rubric). The main criticism I have and that I have heard is not about lectures/section/etc, but rather that the philosophy of the course discourages rather than encourages learning and is set up for us to fail rather than succeed, which does not seem like the point of a college course or learning in general. The assignments are poorly structured, the lectures (with the exception of Pardis section) are boring and dry, which is such a shame for such interesting material and such accomplished professors, and section is laden with activities that waste time and seem geared towards middle school students. Some of the most accomplished biology students in the country come into this class excited and passionate and are leaving discouraged from concentrating in life science. What a shame that this introductory course is doing the one thing that classes should not do: taking away students passions for learning. The introductory science classes at Harvard need a major overhaul.\n",
      "This class isn't as bad as everyone says, although it is pretty bad. I think going into it with the idea that it was going to be horrible made it worse than it actually was though. There's a lot of work and be prepared to put a lot of time into it, but if you do you can do well on exams and psets. GDP though is a different story, good luck with that. The lectures/material can be interesting so at least there's that.\n",
      "The GDP is such a waste of time and some of the lecturers are very dull.\n",
      "It sucks, but you need to take it.\n",
      "If you're not taking this for a pre-med requirement, there is not much reason to take the class. It's a giant lecture class with the majority of students taking it as a pre-med requirement, which can cultivate a somewhat unhealthy environment to be in.\n",
      "Hard, dependent on TF, lectures are too big - but you learn a lot and it's a required prereq.\n",
      "This class was horrible but there is no alternative to taking it if you want to continue in the sciences.\n",
      "Not as bad as people say! I enjoyed the subjects we covered. Sometimes it feels like you're jumping through hoops with all the assignments they give, but 99% are very helpful for learning the material.\n",
      "You have to take this class if you're premed unless you want to take MCB52, which is supposed to be pretty rough.  But unless you're in this situation don't.  You're likely to spend a lot of time frustrated at grading and not quite sure what you're supposed to be studying, and not a lot of time feeling like you're actually building a foundation of knowledge.\n",
      "Make sure to do your math carefully on tests. Grading can be  bit cruel and arbitrary.\n",
      "not too difficult but does require a lot of time sometimes (especially with lab)\n",
      "Don't take this class.  It will be one of your biggest regrets.\n",
      "not as bad as people say, but take it expecting to be annoyed with it and do a lot of the heavy-lifting yourself.  it can be fun though and it's a bonding experience\n",
      "It is very interesting but tedious, and an unnecessary amount of work.\n",
      "LS1b is definitely not that bad. I would go to the PSL sessions and look over the problem solving sessions if you need help with lecture material. They definitely have the resources to help you do well if you want to. Also, don't read the book - you don't need to at all to understand the material. Actually, always go to the problem solving sessions if you want to do well on the midterms!! Amy and Casey explain things really well.\n",
      "I would only recommend this class if you HAVE to take it. It's a bitch, in every way possible, but you just have to get through it. Psets are hard, tests are graded harshly, and GDP is a waste of time, but you just have to get through.\n",
      "Although, from what I've heard, this class has drastically improved over the past couple of years, I still think that the organization of the course needs to be worked on. I think that Kevin, Hopi, and Pardis are all pretty great lecturers (Kevin can be a little condescending in his lecturing, and I think his section is the hardest one to start with), but Dr. Ruvolo is absolutely awful. I wanted to fall asleep, I couldn't pay attention in class when she lectured, and she throws around the word \"fruity\" a lot, which I found offensive. Her lecture slides also make absolutely no sense, and I don't think she explained her concepts very well.\n",
      "If you're a pre-med or biology concentrator, take this class--otherwise it's not worth your time.\n",
      "It's obviously a premed heavy class and that ruins it. The class becomes about jumping through the hoops to do well rather than actually learning.\n",
      "Do the readings! And don't be afraid to ask the preceptors and professors for help!!\n",
      "I approached this class in the wrong way. Honestly it is not that difficult. You need to go to PSL's those are the most helpful thing, and really understand the problem sets. I wish I could redo this course because i came in thinking it was going to be impossible, but it really isn't. Pardis's lectures were the clearest in what actually showed up on the test, but Hopi's were most interesting.\n",
      "Boring class that has some good professors and some bad professors.\n",
      "The material was very interesting and the problem sets were manageable.  However, the exams were very difficult and graded tough.\n",
      "Exams are unfair, Ruvolo is terrible. Everyone else is great however\n",
      "It's pretty interesting, but they don't care about you or your time. Prepare for a terrible 3 hour weekly lab and numerous assignments in reading period.\n",
      "This is going to be horrible, and strong odds are that you will not enjoy this course - but you have to take this, so stick it through. Be prepared for poorly worded assignments, exams, and labs, and general uncertainty over exactly what you're supposed to know. Pardis Sabeti's unit is the only saving grace.\n",
      "Tests are graded extremely subjectively and your grade does not always reflect the amount of time you put into the class.\n",
      "I hated this class. It might have been because of bad preconceptions, but the problem sets were long and unnecessarily difficult, the exams were tricky in a way that I felt didn't really test whether you knew the information. The lectures were long and often quite dull. I'm still going to concentrate in a science, but not because of this class.\n",
      "Only take this class if you need to for your concentration. It is your basic intro science class-- pretty large and frustrating. Professors Hoekstra and Sabeti give this class an upside, but other than them it can be rough to get through.\n",
      "This course has interesting topics but is very difficult to follow. I would say to only take this class if you need to for a concentration requirement.\n",
      "LS1b has the potential to be a awesome course thanks to its cool topics and world-renowned professors. However, this is far from the case. LS1b lectures were boring, the labs terrible uninteresting, and the exams and p-sets were generally based on assumption, ambiguity, and unnecessarily strict rubrics that allowed for nothing by regurgitating exactly what was explained in lecture. The overwhelming swarm of premeds made the class less than enjoyable because they are less interested in learning than they are in getting an A. Also, don't get the textbook. The readings are often less informative than lectures and don't teach anything. Exams are only based on lectures. This is definitely the worst course I've taken at Harvard and even though I did very well, was never enjoyable.\n",
      "Don't take this unless literally forced. Worst class pretty much ever. Made me hate science. Forcefully strayed me away from science and premed and everything. Maryellen Ruvolo is a patronizing old fashioned woman who didn't actually teach methods. Sabeti was great and was the only tiny saving grace of the class. But the class was not saved. Awful. SOS.\n",
      "It's very difficult and requires a strong science background.\n",
      "Really consider if you want to take the class. The tests are difficult, and the GDP is time consuming, graded harshly, and feels more pointless than integrated with the rest of the course.\n",
      "Study hard\n",
      "If you're looking into this course, you probably have to take it, so nothing on the Q will convince you otherwise.  If you're trying to fulfill an elective, look elsewhere.  This class will take too much of your time for merely a gen ed req.\n",
      "This class has a terrible grading rubrik for all my assignments.\n",
      "The material isn't hard to understand, but the exams are.\n",
      "Ls1b is strictly for a pre-med requirement. It is somewhat interesting material and isnt as hard or horrible as everyone says. The teachers take the class too seriously and give assignments out like t hey have to. As long as you do the practice you should be fine.\n",
      "Sadly, this class is required for almost every life science requirement. DO NOT take this course if you don't have to. Too many people, the class takes itself way too seriously, and it's organized in a way that doesn't give students a break. Also the Genetic Disorder Project is a completely useless exercise that I would expect from a lousy high school class, not a college course.\n",
      "There's a lot of work for this course and it sucks, but if you're doing one of the life sciences you have to do it anyways. It's gonna suck but it's just one of those things.\n",
      "It's a decent class overall. Sometimes it's hard to sit through but you learn a lot.\n",
      "It's not as bad as people make it seem.\n",
      "It is difficult, there is no easy way out of this class.\n",
      "The class was terrible.  Unless you need to take it, DON'T.  Literally any other genetics course will teach this material to you better and will be infinitely more enjoyable.  Lectures were three times as long as they needed to be and the assessments are insulting.  Your performance in the class is independent of how well you learn the material.  Honestly, you have to test mindless.  Just memorize the answers they give you and regurgitate them.\n",
      "It's a necessary evil but they have revamped it since the past to make it really accessible for students to get help.\n",
      "Good luck - I am sorry if you have to take this course. If you don't have to take it then DON'T. It is the worst class I (and everyone else) have ever taken at Harvard.\n",
      "It's hard, you'll hate it, there's a lot of work, but it's also required for almost any science concentrator  and pre-meds\n",
      "if you have any hesitation about taking this class, I'd suggest you not take it. it is absolutely terrible. when I first took it, I thought I would grind my teeth through it because \"it can't be THAT bad!\" This was probably one of the worst decisions of my freshman year.\n",
      "It's really just a basic requirement, not a very fun topic depending on where your interests lie but it certainly forms a fundamental base for moving forward with any science involving the human body.\n",
      "It's the worst and the best class I have taken so far.  It is an eye-opener to how cutthroat pre-med kids can be and the material is very interesting.  However, if the material does not appeal to you, do not take this course because it is a boring nightmare otherwise.\n",
      "If you are currently reading this message, that means you are considering this class. Let me tell you: if you know for a CERTAINTY that you do NOT have to take this class, RUN THE OTHER DIRECTION. If you HAVE to take this class, I'm sorry.\n",
      "This course, while serving its purpose as a primer to genetics, is terribly managed, disorganized, and asks too much of its students between 3-hour unproductive labs and hyper-frequent assignments.\n",
      "Not as bad as everyone says it is; it definitely requires hard work, but personally I think the material that you learn is very interesting. Don't come in with a negative mindset. Go to office hours if you need it.\n",
      "The preceptors are really great and the problem solving lectures are probably the most helpful component of the course. The section/lab component is really painful. The labs seem unnecessary and some tfs seem to believe that they need to fill up the whole 3 hours even if there isn't that much material. Also, it's basically impossible to get an A in the course unless you're getting 93 and up on the midterms, which is not an easy feat. oh and the genetic disorder project is completely miserable. I mean, like, really really miserable. It's worth 10% of your grade and graded very harshly.\n",
      "Avoid this class by all means. It is, by far, the very worst course I've ever taken in my life. There is no organization or structure, and assignments are graded solely on use of buzzwords. Terrible class.\n",
      "Such a hard class- but you have to take it\n",
      "You can know the material for this class, and even enjoy the material, but still get a terrible grade.\n",
      "Be prepared to struggle/be bored at times. The lectures, especially the last few, are very boring and move quickly which is a shame considering the material is interesting\n",
      "The class is pretty dry and the work is rather painful. It is ineffectively taught and content is crammed in.\n",
      "This class is hard, but you will learn a lot after taking it.\n",
      "This class did teach me about genetics and ways to calculate different inheritances, but there was little support in comparison to classes like LS1a.\n",
      "THIS COURSE WAS THE WORST COURSE I'VE TAKEN AT HARVARD. I am a junior and this course is not only unorganized, but the lectures rarely apply to exam material and you're often expected to know various topics that are used on exams as well.\n",
      "Be prepared for inconsistent and, in most instances, frustrating grading in the class. That being said, if you're here on the course search and you've reached this comment, you probably have to take it either way (for concentration or pre-med), so I won't discourage you from taking it. You'll learn a lot, but get frustrated along the way. Go to office hours and you'll get through the course.\n",
      "It's really hard to stay focused in this class. The lecture notes posted online are extremely helpful and if you go to the sunday night psl you should be fine on psets but the lectures were painfully long to sit through.\n",
      "I found this course to be less well-organized than its counterpart of LS1a. I do not think the course slides are comprehensive and enough to understand the material, but the lecture notes often provide extraneous information.\n",
      "lots of random work\n",
      "While I did at times enjoy this course, its enormous size and the way the information of is taught made it very difficult. At times I felt that some of the individuals who were supposed to be providing instruction in the course were also overwhelmed by the content being taught.\n",
      "Content isn't that hard, but exams and problem sets can be quite tricky.  Often on problem sets/exams looking for very specific answers.  Going to the PSL study network to check your pset is very helpful.\n",
      "Graded hard and unrewarding\n",
      "Take advantage of the resources offered and you'll do just fine. Stress will be your enemy, but if you can overcome stress, it's really not all that bad and you might just end up having a little fun.\n",
      "This class is hard but doable if you put the work in. Expect psets and tests that are poorly worded.\n",
      "If you are planning on concentrating in the life sciences, then you will sadly have to take this course for credit. If you are not a life sciences concentrator, then avoid this class at all costs. The preceptors make this class difficult to an unnecessary extent and will invent any number of pretenses to give you a worse grade. The lecture material is actually quite interesting but becomes incredibly boring when it gets regurgitated in excessively long section. Labs are not fun.\n",
      "It's a class of 400 people so of course it's not great. Just take it if you have to.\n",
      "Devote a lot of time to studying for exams and quizzes-- the first quiz in 2017 (on circadian rhythm, mutagens and mutation detection, etc.) was particularly difficult.\n",
      "Be prepared to work really hard at memorizing and mastering concepts, yet still feel like you don't understand it after walking out of a test. Accept that your understanding of material is likely not going to be well reflected in your assessments -- and that there's nothing much you can do about it.\n",
      "Grade pretty hard, a lot of content, lectures not great, but got to take so doesn't really matter\n",
      "be ready to work hard, and be frustrated sometimes but the material is cool\n",
      "Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. This is by far the worst class that I have taken at Harvard so far. The biggest problem with the course is that it is completely unorganized. The grading is completely unfair. Credit is given for very specific wordings, rather than understanding of topics at large. Sometimes, they expect extremely long answers with very specific wording, and other times, the accepted answer is only a phrase or two. Expectations for answer lengths, quality, and content are not communicated well. The answer keys and lecture notes are always riddled with mistakes. There have been several occasions where I have been very confused on either a practice problem or a problem set question, and then asked about it at the PSL office hours and have them tell me that the information I had been studying was incorrect. Many times, the solutions to practice problems either only state the answer (with no explanation or work shown) or have the wrong answers, which makes learning from the practice problems very challenging. Essentially, this defeats the purpose of doing the problems. I felt like I could not trust the material that I was learning in the course. I was never confident that the information that I was learning was accurate, which is infuriating considering the amount of money that I am paying for this class. The only strengths of this course were the lecturers (especially Pardis) and the material that we were learning. However, this is not saying much because LS1b has nothing to do with creating the science itself. The only good parts about this course had nothing to do with course itself.\n",
      "It's annoying, but (mostly) fair. If you're premed, you have to take it anyways. I took LPSA, but from what I heard, LS1b is very much like LS1a, so don't take it if you didn't like that. That said, it could have been worse.\n",
      "Unnecessarily difficult for such simple topics.\n",
      "This is a classic pre-med intro class requirement. Painful, but you'll get through it. Read the lecture notes online religiously, it's where most of the memorization exam questions come from.\n",
      "Be ready to work hard but learn a lot.\n",
      "This class is required so you have to take it but you'll be miserable every second. The assessments do not gauge your understanding of the material and lecture notes are very poorly written often containing incorrect or inconsistent material. Labs and psets are graded in a very nitpicky fashion, and TFs are instructed by the rubric to take off points for formatting things incorrectly or not writing them in the right way. Lab itself is extremely boring and probably the single most useless aspect of my week. You learn absolutely nothing of actual use in this class. It is just memorization. You learn how to do one type of calculation, have no actual conceptual understanding it, and just do it over and over on the assessments. Unlike LS1a, lectures are uninteresting and not worth attending, just watch them on 2x speed later. Every aspect of this class is actually just insufferable. (I liked Hopi)\n",
      "Use lecture notes to help study for assessments and for doing problem sets. Think carefully about conceptual topics as these will come up on the exams.\n",
      "This class' material is not necessarily difficult, it is the grading that is what makes it difficult.\n",
      "This class is very useful but just run badly.\n",
      "This is an awful class. The psets, quizzes, exams, section handouts etc. are written by different people with VERY different understanding of the class. Its annoying how a question as simple as writing a null hypothesis, which has a formulated consistent answer, is written in 7 different ways by 7 different people in the assignments leading up to the exam. The exams are written to trick you based on the patterns that show up in practice problems. They know you will recognize the question, and then take advantage of this by twisting some minor detail in half of a sentence in the page-long question setup and you'll end up getting 0 credit. The practice exams are WAY easier than the actual exams. 15 minutes for the quizzes is simply not enough. This class' material is not hard, its the high level of reading comprehension, fast working, test taking skills under pressure, and luck that will help you.\n",
      "Terribly taught, assignments are not fun or interesting and the class is very difficult. out to get you with bad grades.\n",
      "H-O-R-R-I-B-L-E. This class was an absolute s**t show. Kevin was one of the worst professors I've ever had, the exams were unnecessarily hard and asked questions that were very unreasonable, the grading on the exams was beyond ridiculous and you were only awarded points if you had the exact word for word phrase of an answer, the preceptors did not know what they were doing, and the labs were long and drawn out. The only good things about LS1b were Hopi and Pardis's lectures, and Drago as a TF. And the fact that everyone was in the same boat so we could all complain and cry together. Otherwise, my only advice is to study the practice exams and practice problems, see your TF, and pray.\n",
      "This class has a lot of random assignments that don't really further your understanding of what you are supposed to be learned. Problem sets are mildly helpful.\n",
      "If I did not know for sure that I wanted to concentrate in a STEM field this would have turned me away from science all together. This class was awful. Had to take it for premed. Try to test out if you can.\n",
      "If you have to take this course, it won't be too bad.\n",
      "This was a decent intro science course. If your're in a stem concentration or are pre-med you probably have to take this class and the material is very interesting and cool so its not that bad. With that being said, the lectures can often be boring and it felt like the class limited creativity with very strict grading standards.\n",
      "This class requires you to put in the effort outside of class to read the pre-lecture slides. you should also do the p sets earlier than a few days before it's due so that you can have time to go to office hours and help centers to understand how the p set is actually asking.\n",
      "Unfortunately, this course followed through with its bad reputation. The grading was tough and the lectures were sub-par. The information is super interesting, it's just unfortunate that it was taught in such a bad way.\n",
      "If you can avoid, do so!!! Very hard grading.\n",
      "Its horrible, unorganized but  its required for most science concentrations so you have to suffer through it.  I wouldnt recommend taking this course unless you have to.\n",
      "This course sucks\n",
      "I would not recommend this class until it has been heavily restructured. The grading of psets, labs, and midterms does not accurately reflect students' mastery of the material. No course-wide review sessions are held for quizzes or midterms. The preceptors are not encouraging or accessible. There is very little cohesiveness or guidance in the class. Since people interested in sciences will probably take this class because they have to, learn to memorize key phrases and buzz words to regurgitate them on exams.\n",
      "Interesting material. Terrible class.\n",
      "This class is just so awful. The professors teach as though we know absolutely nothing. Problem sets and exams are frustrating because of the poorly-written questions. It sucks that this class is a requirement/prerequisite for so many classes/concentrations. If you can find a way to avoid this class, do.\n",
      "When doing psets and exams remember to put down as many buzzwords and write down information that may seem obvious.  Also the class required you to know a lot of small details so don't forget to study those too.\n",
      "The course is very picky about how it grades and assesses its students. Prepare to feel that points were unfairly docked on both problem sets and exams.\n",
      "You probably need to take it. Its not as bad as everyone says it is.\n",
      "LS1b seemed to have dramatically improved from the way it was taught in the past.\n",
      "Very time consuming and very difficult to do well. Boring material, especially if you don't love genetics.\n",
      "A lot depends on how harshly your TF grades. There's not much standardization across the board. This is also a system with very little forgiveness (I guess in other words, I'm used to having the opportunity to drop a lowest PSET or exam), because everything counts. From what I've heard from a lot of people, it's easy to do well in the class for the semester, and then the exam is pretty difficult with a lot of tricky questions\n",
      "This class covers interesting material, but can be very frustrating in terms of how helpful the teaching staff is outside of class.\n",
      "The last portion of the class is very boring, but Andrew Berry's middle section is amazing.\n",
      "This course is a lot better now with Andrew Berry teaching and with the long and tedious project from previous years taken away. Marking can be a little difficult, but the material isn't hard to understand. The lecturers were enthusiastic and section was helpful, depending on your TF. Labs were average.\n",
      "Great labs that will teach you a ton and let you use some of the latest bio technologies! Unfortunately, the exams and problem sets are quite terrible, not because of difficulty but because they are graded unfairly and have bad questions.\n",
      "This class is hard, and you have to put work in.  Even if you do that, you probably won't see your grades where you feel they should be.  Reach out to teaching fellows, and do it earlier.  Do your problem sets with friends or you might not make it.\n",
      "Reviewing weekly will be a tremendous help for midterms and finals. Although the class may seem difficult at times, the help you receive throughout the week will get you through it.\n",
      "Do not take this class. If possible take an OEB alternative. This class is poorly taught, the preceptors are condescending and terrible instructors and overall, you will not be evaluated on your ability to be successful in STEM, only on how well you can memorize and regurgitate information.\n",
      "Andrew and Pardis are amazing people and lecturers. Section is extremely tedious and boring, and if your TF doesn't have good time management you may end up going 30 min-1 hour over time. However, the section problems are really helpful for understanding the material and how to do the problem sets. Each TF grades the problem set very differently, which was annoying. It's doable, but it's not going to be a pleasant experience.\n",
      "The professors are really cool, which makes the rather boring material bearable.\n",
      "I mean i don't recommend it but you gotta take it\n",
      "It's a difficult class to do well in, because the exams are difficult. However, there are a lot of resources available, so use them! Psets also help significantly with exams.\n",
      "There's really not a good reason to take this course if you aren't a pre-med.\n",
      "I would say that you need to take this course in order to obtain a solid foundation in genetics. However, I do believe the course is pretty poorly executed with variable grading and very different section experiences.\n",
      "This course is moderately difficult; however, you learn a lot about the genetics and the labs help you develop basic lab skills.\n",
      "Only take it if you have to. This class is really really difficult.\n",
      "Big time commitment. I would probably only recommend this class for people seriously considering a biology major or secondary\n",
      "You probably have to take this class. It's not great, it's not horrible. Lab will drag on\n",
      "Most likely have to take, one of the worst classes you will take. Just survive.\n",
      "This class sucks.  If you don't have to take it don't.\n",
      "Do the practice problems and practice exams and you'll be fine. Section/lab was the most boring three hour stretch of my week.\n",
      "This course has a bad reputation overall at Harvard, with record low Q scores in the past. However, I think it's actually turned into quite a decent course. Berry and Sabeti are freaking amazing lecturers, and Eggan isn't bad either. Also, Sabeti is insanely cool. Another thing - a lot of the course is focused on statistical methods in biology. This is nice, but they don't go into as much explanation of the math as you might like. This was a little annoying, but it's whatever.\n",
      "LS1b used to have a really bad reputation for being terrible, but that definitely wasn't my experience. Though it was difficult at times, I thought LS1b was well-taught and was interesting. I don't know that I would take this class if it wasn't a requirement, but I didn't mind that it was a requirement.\n",
      "It's not like LS1A where everything builds on the previous modules. The lectures within modules are connected, but beyond that, there is not much between modules.\n",
      "This class is not particularly difficult or time consuming, but complete assignments carefully as one can lose a lot of points for careless errors.\n",
      "You aren't taking this class for fun: you are either pre-med or it is a concentration requirement. That said, I didn't think it was as terrible as what I had heard in years past.\n",
      "Unless you absolutely have to for your concentration, do not take LS1A and LS1B. As a non-scientist or non-biologist, you will hate everything about it. You will probably hate everything about it even as a scientist or biologist, but in that case you can console yourself knowing you pretty much had to take it.\n",
      "Sucks\n",
      "It can be very interesting at times, very boring and hard at othersit is worth your time if you are premed or need the requirement for somethingotherwise, don't take it\n",
      "Unless you either love genetics or absolutely have to take this course, don't. I had to take LS1B for premed and concentration requirements and now wish I just hadn't . If I could go back to my past self I would say switch/alter my concentration rather than going through the agony of this course. The projects are a lot of work that sometimes feel like busy work. The worst part however is how unfair the questions in the class are. Psets ask questions that are difficult to answer without going to office hours. Even if you understand the concept, the way LS1B asks it and the unnecessary background info they give makes it difficult. The exams cover a wide degree of breath, and the material is just so much to cover in an exam. You could know the concepts in an exam but the way they were presented just made it difficult to portray this, and the amount of work makes tests difficult to prepare for. The course will take a lot of time, but the main part I did not like about it was how unfair the questions were. Also, if you do not have a strong genetics background/ your high school did not teach it like me, you are in for a really hard time. It is super easy to fall behind and never catch up. The lectures are fine and the instructors make an effort to make it interesting, but the actual material and your grade can be unbearable if you do not really love genetics or have some familiarity. If I could go back, I would not take LS1B and choose some other biology class, literally any other class, to fulfill that requirement for medical school. Even if the grading hadn't been harsh, the soul-suckingness of the class and the struggle of getting through just isn't worth it to me. Also, you have to buy a $15 course pack at the beginning of the semester for lab, which came as a surprise to me.\n",
      "This course is super hard but the material is really interesting. Nearly impossible to get an A depending on your TF. Take if necessary.\n",
      "It is harder than LPSA or LS1A and the exams are much more difficult\n",
      "Study everything. Little things that you think don't matter will matter on the exam. Don't let the curveballs get you.\n",
      "Not a fun class; just a requirement you have to get through.\n"

    "a =  [\"Ls1b is a great course if you want to learn about evolution and many modern biological research concepts.\",\"The material itself is not hard and the exams are not horrible, the main problem I had with this class was the GDP and the general harsh grading system.\",\"Well-taught class, but many (sometimes tedious) assignments.\",\"Be prepared to work.\",\"Only take this course if you have to.\",\"I mean it's necessary for pre-med, so I guess I would have to recommend it in that regard. I was on the fence about pre-med, and now I am not on the fence; I have plummeted from the fence and will probably crash on the comfy squishy Economics landing mat.\",\"This class is a lot of work. You have to be really excited about the material and OK with spending hours in a lab to get through it.\",\"Meh..... I think one of my biggest mistakes was not starting to study early enough and not attending Office Hours\",\"It is not as bad as everyone makes it sound. The PSLs are helpful if you need a repitition of information, but they can be a bit slow.\",\"The lectures are large and rather uninformative with regards to problem sets\\/ exams. The grading is terribly specific. The course seemed unnecessarily difficult.\",\"The lecturers are amazing at their work in the lecture hall and outside. They are a really interesting group of scientists and I think that if you enjoy learning about genetics, the work you have to put into the class isn't too bad.\",\"This is a beast of a class. Three midterms, essentially two full problem sets per week, on top of a three hour section. It's a lot of work. However, the professors are all great, especially Hopi and Pardis. Take if you want to persue biology, but know that you'll be in for a slog of a semester. If you're looking for gen ed credit, consider a more fun course.\",\"I have to recommend it because it is a very helpful course and is required for most life sciences and is very helpful for premed. It's a good preparation for upper level science classes at Harvard.\",\"I'm really sorry you will be forced to take this course as a biology concentrator or pre-med student. It really was awful. The material itself is interesting but not challenging, and problem sets and exams aren't that bad, but it is so poorly taught and organized. There are unnecessary readings every week (which I wouldn't recommend doing), pointless labs, and demanding GDP question sets, which are graded far too harshly. This is a bad course, but you'll survive.\",\"I would recommend this course because it is a good base for any science concentrator but for no other reason. It was really difficult.\",\"If you had a good AP biology course in high school, most of the first half of the course should be review, while the second half touches on some newer trends in population genetics.  However, that doesn't mean that you will do well, even if you know all of the material very well.  The questions can be asked very poorly and the grading done very unfairly.\",\"People say it's a terrible class. But it really isn't. It is different from Ls1a, but if you just do the things they ask of you. Do the practice exams, read the lecture notes, you can actually really enjoy it.\",\"You have to take this course, but you don't have to enjoy it. Work through the questions without thinking about their meaning and you'll do better than if you try to understand the material. Everything is based on whether or not you can do calculations, so just exhaustively do those and you'll make it to the end.\",\"DON'T TAKE IT UNLESS YOU HAVE TO\",\"This course, while very interesting at times, can also be quite boring. It seemed like most of the time the material we learned was quite easy, yet psets came out of nowhere and tests were bizarre.\",\"A decent course with great information, but can be frustrating at times.\",\"People don't really take LS1b unless it's a concentration or pre-med requirement and there is a reason for that. It won't blow your mind but it does provide a good refresher of material from AP bio and even some new interesting tidbits. It's also very easy. Take the class, but take it with something that is super interesting so you don't have a boring semester.\",\"You'll have a lot of work due every Monday (problems sets and GDP question sets) - be sure to plan ahead\",\"LS1b is a difficult course with a great deal of work, but it is ultimately very fulfilling. You will leave the course feeling more prepared to enter the ever-changing world of medicine and medical research. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe lectures (while a bit long) are engaging and explain the material effectively, and exams are usually reasonable. The assignments will enrich your understanding of the material, but are often extremely time-consuming. There are weekly problem sets, weekly genetic disorder question sets (which require extensive research), and three midterm exams (each of which is 2 hours). \\r\\n\\r\\nThere is also a weekly lab period, which is usually exciting. You have the rare opportunity to sequence your own DNA.  \\r\\n\\r\\nIn summary, if you choose to take LS1b, you will have to devote a lot of your time to it. But in the end, it is worth it, especially for those who are passionate about medicine.\",\"You probably have to take this course. You will put a lot of effort into it, for very little result. Try to go into it with a positive attitude, because that's as good as its going to get.\",\"Not all of the professors are great, but the course material is interesting and most of the instructors are very helpful. Also, Pardis is an absolute gem.\",\"The tests are really hard and Kevin's lectures are boring, but Pardis is AMAZING and the material is really cool.\",\"The course is rigorous, and very different from LS1a. Some elements of the grading is unfair, especially in the GDP project. The class can be occasionally time consuming. Altogether not a very enjoyable experience.\",\"Avoid Kevin like the plague. Pardis is a god-send\",\"This class is highly antagonistic and frustrating. If you study more intensely than you've ever studied before, perhaps you'll eventually do well. It's very much a game you have to learn how to play. Pardis and Hopi especially improve the course, but outside of them there's not a lot of positivity.\",\"If you have heard things about LS1b, those things are probably not true anymore. They have revamped the course and honestly, it was probably my favorite course of the semester. Each lecturer is so influential in their respective fields and having professors that are experts who are enthusiastic about the material they teach is the best way to learn something. I think it would be unnecessary for the course to change the way LS1a did. The midterms were fair as were the psets. Any issues with the material or lectures could easily be cleared up at office hours which were always incredibly helpful. The only not great thing about the class was the GDP. They did change the grading scheme in the middle of the project which made it better and the GDP symposium was actually incredibly interesting.\",\"This class is not a fun time, but you have to take it for requirements.  There's a ridiculous amount of work (if you do everything you're actually supposed to - readings, etc.) that doesn't really pay off.  Go to office hours with your TF, do the practice problems. Don't stress about the lectures themselves though.\",\"Do not take this course if it is not required. There are may other coursed that are much more interesting and better structured if you are interested in taking a life science course.\",\"difficult, GDP is frustrating, but also very rewarding and interesting material\",\"Lecture slides are very helpful and relevant to midterms and finals.\",\"You take this because you have to. It's too big of a class, the labs are a pain and sometimes ineffective (pick beads out of yarn, SCIENCE), weekly GDP question sets were annoying and time consuming. But ultimately you can succeed in this class if you put in the work each week - review lectures so you're not cramming by exams, work with other people on psets, work through practice problems when you can. There's a ton of resources to help you succeed and get a tutor if you're struggling with the material. Hopi and Pardis should be the bookends of the course because their presentation and fields are most engaging.\",\"The information in the class is awesome, but sometimes the way it is taught is poor.\",\"The material is interesting while some components of the class are less engaging\",\"Ask your TFs if you need help. Especially Rickey.\",\"This is a good class and I found it to be a lot better than what people generally say. Make sure you get a good TF -- that's the key to doing well in this class! Joyce is the most AMAZING TF, try to be in her section if you can! In terms of lecture, Kevin's lectures are okay but Pardis's and Hopi's lectures are amazing! When you get to Maryellen's lectures, you'll be confused in class but if you go over the notes on your own time, you should be okay. Problem solving reviews were not that helpful so skip them if you need to.\",\"not as bad as people say. just do practice problems! learn to problem-solve and you will be okay\",\"It's a good class - it definitely isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. That being said, if you object strongly to pre-med classes (classes where people will work really hard for exams, where starting a pset the day before it's due means most people are done, etc), then it might be annoying. GDP also sucks.\\r\\n\\r\\nI loved the material, though, and thought that the course was really fun. Exams were fair, and I felt like I learned a ton. Don't be afraid of this class just because people say it's bad. If you go in telling yourself you hate it you'll hate it, but that's how life works.\",\"The material in this course is actually quite interesting, but you will feel like it is a lot worse than it is because the amount of busy work required in the course. The Genetics Disorder Project is extremely annoying because every question set for it is due the same day as the problem set, giving you twice as much work, and you won't feel like you are getting much from the project simply because you'll just do it to get it done quickly rather than to learn well from it.\",\"I think it is quite rare for anyone to take this class by choice, but even so the class really isn't that bad.

Most of the professors are great--you get to learn from people who are at the top of the their field--and the class is not too hard if you attend lectures and keep up with psets. The best part of the class is the labs in which you get to create transgenic organisms and analyze your own DNA. The worst part is something called \\\"GDP Project\\\" which will basically require you to do an extra pset every week.

The course requires a significant amount of time spent in class, section, and various assignments.\",\"I would say that you should only take LS1b if you have to or are really interested in genetics because the experience of the class doesn't have much to offer except giving you a basic understanding of genetics. It does a good job of covering its material, though it presents it in a way that is very focused on human disease. The GDP project is painful and pretty pointless, but the problem sets and the exams do a good job of making sure you have learned the material.\",\"You are probably taking this class because you have to. It is challenging, but mostly incredibly frustrating. Make sure you keep up with the material, and - don't forget -  there is life beyond LS1b.\",\"Do not take this course unless it is a requirement for premed or concentration. There are many classes at Harvard that give a much better understanding of genetics and are much more rewarding than this one.\",\"LS1b will probably be your first in-depth exposure to a specific topic in biology, unless you've done research in the past. The genetic material #nopunintended is actually really interesting. The first unit covers basic cell process\\/mendelian genetics stuff, but after that everything is new (for me at least, a student who took Bio and Chem AP in high school). You'll learn about actual research techniques, nuances of all the basic stuff you knew, front-line biological advances, etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nThere's a lot of work, and it is a big pain in the ass sometimes, but that's to be expected from a science class.

The problem sets are tough, but could be worse, and help solidify most concepts taught in class. the GDP is awful - it takes longer to complete than the problem set & section\\/lab component combined, students received no training on how to complete on properly and it was extremely difficult to get anything higher than a C on one problem set. The GDP also didn't help understand what was taught in class or teach anything newer than what could be found on Google.

At times, this course made me question my interest in continuing to pursue life sciences. This was frustrating because I was so excited for the material, but the arbitrariness of grading and ineffectiveness in assessing students' understanding of the material, made this course a lot more stressful than I would have liked. Rather than enjoying the information, I often felt stressed trying to understand what I needed to do get a good grade according to the course staff. This was a very unpleasant experience, especially when I knew I could effectively exemplify my knowledge to my TF orally and not have this reflected in my assignment grades. The course instructors, however, are truly wonderful and there are tons of resources put in place to assist you over the course of the semester.\",\"Compared to what I've heard about past years, this class has improved a lot and I have no doubt it will keep improving.

However, the course was a lot of work at times, and could feel a bit overwhelming.\",\"It's truly a shame that a course taken by so many freshmen, and one that covers such interesting material, remains so uninspiring. The homework feels largely like busy work and the tests designed more to trip up than to promote learning.

Hoekstra and Sabeti are the stars of the show, even though Sabeti pretty much only knows what she lectures on in class and isn't too helpful outside of class. The problem sets are very easy, but don't prepare you for exams. The practice problems for each lecture are definitely what prepares you for exams. Section component of the class is week, and labs are tedious and don't feel connected to the rest of the course. The GDP is just a pain you have to get through. Watch out, because it is graded very harshly. Be sure to talk to your TF for the first assignment so you know how to write up answers. Exams are challenging but nothing you can't study to do well on. The final was definitely tough though!\",\"I know that a lot of people think this is just a \\\"pre-med\\\" class, and that it's just one of those courses that you \\\"have to take,\\\" but I actually think there's a lot of interesting material to learn, and it is a far more real-life applicable course than LS1a. I don't think it is a better class than LS1a, but the lecturers are really incredible people and should be taken advantage of, and I personally didn't find the work to be that difficult.

On the one hand, most of the material was really interesting (genetics and evolution is my favorite part of bio) and most of the lectures were pretty decent. On the other hand, parts of the class were pretty nonsensical.

This is basically a statistics course in biology.\",\"The grading is very unfair.\",\"Do not take this unless you absolutely have to\",\"Take it since it goes more in depth than AP Biology, but do not underestimate the class because you need to put in worm to get a good grade.\",\"This was an awful class. The exams absolutely kill you. Lectures & materials are very interesting, but the problem solving lectures on Fridays are too long and too useless. There should be more support from the preceptors to students.\",\"The more work you put in, the more you will get out of this class. The best tip I can give for this class would be to substitute doing readings from the book with doing practice problems.\",\"This class is not hard material wise, but you will hate it while you're taking it. The lectures are impossible to sit through (except Pardis) and the GDP project is unreasonable and frustrating. I once, instead of doing the GDP prompt, which I found to be frustratingly vague, drafted an e-mail to my TF about the problems I have with the GDP. It goes as follows: \\r\\n\\r\\n\\\"Before I submit my GDP Problem Set 5, I just wanted to apologize for the quality of work that I had to put my name on, and explain why it is so low. I would consider the GDP to be the worst part of not only my Harvard education thus far, but my entire experience as a student since pre-kindergarten. \\r\\n\\r\\nI understand the idealistic \\\"relevance\\\" this project is supposed to provide for us, however to make this project which often times feels disjointed and unrelated to the material we were learning 12% of our total grade is absolutely absurd. I find myself each week absolutely dreading the \\\"guided research\\\" of the GDP; I would much rather have one research paper due at the end of the semester than have this dragging responsibility over my head each week.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhat is more, I find that not allowing students to choose their own subject limits the enthusiasm for this project significantly. I cannot find an ounce of will power to study galactosemia in this much detail. While it would be interesting to spend a few slides of lecture learning about this topic, this overkill of something I do not have any interest in is, in itself, overwhelming. If I were able to research a topic of my interest, I believe I would look forward to this research, even in the painstaking, dragged out format that is currently in place. \\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, this is a freshman introductory genetics course; if there is some notion that this is a way to get students excited about genetics, there is a severe disconnect in the sentiment of students and the course staff. This project taints what would otherwise be a relatively satisfactory introduction to genetics, and I strongly suggest a significant remodeling in the future. \\r\\n\\r\\nI really hate the idea of not submitting my best work, but it seems impossible to figure out the grading system, which seems to vary significantly from week to week, and has been increasingly frustrating for me as a student. I do not feel I am learning anything through this project.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough all of these reasons, you can see how it might be difficult to motivate myself to complete each of these problem sets, and might explain, in part, the poor grades I have received on the GDP, and probably in the class, as a result.\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope this rant does not come across as disrespectful; I enjoy my time in section and your teaching. I simply cannot participate in another GDP problem set and will accept what this means for my grade. I hope in the future this project is changed dramatically, or in an ideal world, completely abolished, for the sake of the future students of this course.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nI am pretty proud of this e-mail and I think it captures the sentiment of the student body as a whole on this project. I took orgo before ls1b because I thought I might not need ls1b for my concentration but ended up having to take it, and I found ORGANIC CHEMISTRY to be a more pleasant experience, just for a frame of reference.\",\"This class gives you some basics in regards to genetics, genomics, and evolution. However, the material is spread and arranged in an odd manner that does not provide for a cohesive learning experience, and you may even be better off teaching the material to yourself. Don't take it unless for a biology concentration requirement, and especially do not take it to fulfill your SLS Gen Ed requirement. There are many other better options.\",\"Loved LS1b! Genetics is fascinating, and this class gets into some of the cool details that glossed over in high school explanations.  Super cool to get to work with our own DNA and some of the lecturers are fantastic-take the class just for the chance to have Pardis Sabeti, one of Time's \\\"100 most influential people.\\\" She's actually incredible.\",\"GDP problem sets really suck and are not enjoyable at all. The grading scheme for them is terrible, but overall the course material is super interesting and extremely enjoyable.\",\"Try and see if you can fulfill your Pre-med and concentration requirement with another class.\",\"LS1b kinda sucks, but it's a good course to take if you're premed. Lots of freshmen take it. The Genetic Disorder Project sucks balls.\",\"A lot of students take this class as a pre-med requirement. Therefore, many students find this class and its work annoying and tedious, as they are only doing it because it is required of them. As someone who was not sure if they wanted to stick with the pre-med route, I can say that this class is definitely not that bad. It made me decide not to continue with the pre-med course track, but only because I realized that these types of classes were not for me. The material was definitely interesting, but LS1b required a lot of time outside of class for someone like me for which the material did not catch on super quickly. It took me a lot of extra practice to grasp most of the concepts, which I didn't really have time for. It was very stressful at times, and I never seemed to do as well as I wanted. With that said, I don't regret taking this class. Again, the material is really fascinating, and there is a great community of students in this class, as everyone struggles together, haha. Resources outside the class are great for additional help.\",\"Many people hate on this course, I honestly learned a ton of genetics. This course covers a lot of material and the material is very interesting.\",\"Only take it if its required\",\"Test out if you can.\",\"A class that is designed to make you think inside the box. In all of your evaluations (homework, section, exams), you will very rarely be asked to think for yourself. Rather, the most difficult lesson that I had to learn in this class was that we always will have been given the right answer in lecture, and all that is expected for you is to reproduce this answer.\",\"This course is required for my pre-med requirement. The material is extremely interesting and worth learning because it is vital to understanding the importance of research and how it applies to real world problems. However, the way the course is structured is horrible. The way work is evaluated needs serious work. There are times were I know the material cold and my TF has acknowledged that fact, yet on the exam it doesn't reflect because questions are unclear or specific in a way that the wording must be familiar. I was told to simply memorize question structures over reviewing lecture notes and material and it makes the class grading confusing and unfair in my opinion. I think grading and evaluation structure needs tremendous work.\",\"It's frustrating, but not terribly difficult. Take it if you need to, because it'll let you take more interesting classes later on, but don't expect it to be very exciting, even if you enjoy the material. Exams are worth studying for, but can be annoyingly ambiguous--it feels like you're trying to guess what they want you to say, instead of applying what they've taught you. Pardis is awesome though!\",\"I would only take LS1b if you need to. I'm sure there are many more interesting and less stressful ways to learn about genetics and evolution.

Watch out for the GDP project, which is worth more of your grade than you think it is and is graded very harshly--without much warning at all.\",\"Depending on your concentration, you might have to take this class.

Try to find some good people to ride it out with.\",\"I really liked the content of the course. Genetics is a fascinating subject. That being said, I was extremely frustrated with the grading and feedback, and Maryellen's lectures were extremely boring.\",\"Good class overall, better than I expected. LS1b has a lot of breadth, but is lacking in depth - most of the techniques and problems are simple or easy, and only some are confusing or tricky (at least for me). The Genetic Disorder Project question sets were tricky to get right at first (research, writing, and citing) and were overall time consuming, so doing them the night before was stressful for me. Overall, I think the GDP does help teach the rigors of writing and learning about a subject in depth. The professors are good. I don't think it makes too much sense to take this as a SLS gen-ed. There are a lot of resources and office hours, and I would suggest using enough for you to succeed - I went to the Sunday pset sessions, but not the Friday problem solving lectures, and I didn't read the textbook. I'm taking this as a sophomore OEB concentrator (and it's fine), because I decided to take LS100r (a research course) in freshman year instead, which I think was a good decision - consider doing that if you want to see if you like bio\\/research. A positive attitude helps.\",\"It's just an okay course (for the most part. Some parts are cool A++). Wouldn't have taken it if it wasn't a concentration requirement. A lot of busy work with the GDP.\",\"Only take this class if its a concentration requirement. Interesting material is damaged by lack of focus on understanding.\",\"There is a fair amount of work involved in the class, but I found it to be highly interesting work. Read up a little bit on each of the professors; they are so incredibly accomplished in their fields (Pardis was named to Time's 100 Most Influential while she was our teacher) and their own modesty can prevent that from being conveyed. It's pretty remarkable to get to have them and so I would encourage trying to realize that.\",\"The material the course is supposed to encompass is very interesting and important for those considering a career in modern medicine.  However, the course itself requires what seems like a lot of busy work, and the lectures, in general, weren't the least bit useful in succeeding in this course.\",\"If you're on a biology or premed track, you probably have to take this class. Hopefully it will get better for you guys, because it wasn't pleasant. With all that being said, don't go into it with the wrong mindset: try to get as much out of it as possible. Also, don't waste your money on the textbooks.

The GDP can also be enjoyable if you give yourself enough time to do each set of questions, and it will feel rewarding at the end. Lastly, definitely go to everyone of Dr. Sabeti's lectures--she is the best lecturer by far, and you'll just have to stick out the disappointment of Ruvolo's lectures right afterwards.\",\"LS1b is really easy. Just be willing to spend countless hours on pointless and tedious assignments.\",\"I found the material interesting and, for the most part, the lectures were not too bad.

Cool to get a survey of a bunch of different topics within concepts, though the downside is that you rotate through 4 different professors and units that sometimes see disjointed.

The hardest part was dealing with three midterms and psets every week (plus the Genetic Disorder Project, which was the worst part of this class in my opinion. Learning about genetic disorders from real doctors and patients at the end of the semester was super cool, but the GDP problems were very difficult and we didn't receive very helpful support for the most part).

There is plenty of help and guidance throughout if you are willing to put in just a little extra time and focus.

In terms of work, you will have to review a lot to really understand the material, and to work through the psets. Attendance is MANDATORY (clicker questions), so that's something to also think about. Lecture itself is usually pretty boring and hard to follow; the lecturers are all amazing and well known in the field but have trouble translating that into good teaching;  the post-lecture notes are what will get you through this class. Section will basically be a 3 hour waste of your life, so think about that when choosing a time for section. The tests are very hard (everyone fails the first one (this year, the avg was 77) and then cries about it), try to do practice problems for every single lecture and start studying 1-2 weeks before.  Take advantage of Amy and Casey, the course preceptors.

However, be warned that there are a lot of basic statistical tests you must learn throughout the course.\",\"Some parts are hard but if you're at all interested in life sciences, especially the more biology oriented ones then I highly reccomend this\",\"Really interesting topics - the course also gets better as it goes on. Going to office hours really helps.\",\"LS1b gets a bad wrap. On average, people don't do too well in this course and therefore think about it negatively. I didn't do well in the course but I still loved it. Go into this course with an open mind willing to learn and it will be enjoyable. Take advantage of office hours for sure. The GDP is a silent killer. Many people found it pointless, but for me the GDP was my favorite part of the course. It was a project dedicated to doing research and learning more about something new on your own time. It's mostly an independent thing, so you will get out of it what you put into it. The GDP really ties the ideas of the course back into reality.\",\"It's harder than LS1a. Much different in experience.\",\"You will love some parts of it and hate others\",\"LS1B is tough and it's crucial that you start the course on a good foot. Try to do well on the first exam to set the tone. I messed up on the first exam and it was difficult to compensate for that even though I did fairly well on the second and third exams. Also, don't be afraid to get a tutor. I got a tutor for LS1B before I started the course and she was very helpful when I needed her. Take advantage of the Friday problem solving reviews too.\",\"People love to complain about LS1b, but in reality it's not a bad class. There workload is steady but not difficult, and there are plenty of resources to help. That said, the GDP is terrible and completely negates all positive aspects of the course.Make sure you attend Friday problem solving lectures or at least watch the videos.

Save yourself the stress,\",\"You will gain a lot of applicable and important knowledge about genetics from this class.\",\"It actually wasn't that bad at the end of the day: the problem lies in how bureaucratic the day-to-day assignments are. The lecturers are experts in their fields and absolutely excellent, and your section experience, like all classes, will depend on your TF. There are two main problems with this class:\\r\\n1) the Genetic Disorder Project, which I would guess is intended to be a creative outlet to inspire scientific curiosity but is instead the bane of every premed and non-premed's existence. The idea is to answer a set of open-ended questions about a particular genetic disorder, but the rubric on which it is graded is completely obscure, incredibly specific, and harsh. GDP is weighted equally to your problem sets, even though 95% of the learning in this class is the problem sets (so this makes no sense). Intuitively, it becomes an after thought and nothing more than a chore where no one really learns much at all.\\r\\n2) the bureaucracy as a whole is suffocating when you want to change sections, need an extension on a problem set or lab assignment (hint: YOU WILL NEVER GET ONE even if you are medically incapacitated), hate your TF, or are hated by your TF.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat all being said, I think the material was an excellent introduction to genetics and its modern techniques, even with the occasional busywork.\",\"This class is definitely interesting, but be prepared to spend a lot of time on the subject matter.

But try not to fall into the trap thinking, \\\"Well, I did super duper well in LPSA\\/LS1b so this class should be a breeze!\\\" If you think like that, you'll get a 70 on your first exam, straight-up.

Theres new stuff that is really interesting if you approach it with an open mind!\",\"LS1b was not completely awful, but it was also not exactly enjoyable. This is a course in progress. From what I've heard from students who took it in the past, it has come a long way and is still improving. It is not easy, and it's a lot of work, but the information itself is interesting and actually has a lot of real world applications.

The hardest part was the GDP and PSETs slamming you sunday nights.\",\"It's a tough course and isn't taught too well, but the material is very interesting and manageable as long as you put in the effort to do practice problems and study the material yourself.\",\"i.\\tFrom all my friends and peers in the class that I have talked to, I get the sense that the most dissatisfying part of the course is the philosophy or attitude towards our learning. Rather than feeling encouraged to learn and being positively rewarded for our efforts, we are punished by unnecessarily strict rubrics on the GDP (which don't do anything for our learning but discourage us- when we put in effort to learn something but aren't rewarded for it because of minutia) or by no rewarding of partial credit on psets\\/exams (because one word is different from what was written on the rubric). The main criticism I have and that I have heard is not about lectures\\/section\\/etc, but rather that the philosophy of the course discourages rather than encourages learning and is set up for us to fail rather than succeed, which does not seem like the point of a college course or learning in general. The assignments are poorly structured, the lectures (with the exception of Pardis\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 section) are boring and dry, which is such a shame for such interesting material and such accomplished professors, and section is laden with activities that waste time and seem geared towards middle school students. Some of the most accomplished biology students in the country come into this class excited and passionate and are leaving discouraged from concentrating in life science. What a shame that this introductory course is doing the one thing that classes should not do: taking away students\\u00e2\\u20ac\\u2122 passions for learning. The introductory science classes at Harvard need a major overhaul.\",\"Psets and Lecturers are pretty good (Pardis Sabeti is the bomb dot com) but the Genetic Disorder Project kills you and preparing for exams is frustrating (since the review materials often mislead you as to what the exam is actually like)\",\"The material is interesting and the course as a whole is engaging. Some lectures can be boring for 1 1\\/2 hours. Section is the most educational aspect of the class where you will actually learn how to apply concepts in lecture. Labs can feel pointless at times, but I guess they are useful for learning basic techniques. The one downside of LS1b is the amount of work required per week. The problem set alone is manageable, but combined with the weekly GDP question set, it is a lot of work. I found this to be the least enjoyable aspect of the course.\",\"I was hesitant to take this course as I heard bad things about it, but it was my favorite class this semester. It was not easy, but the material was very interesting for me, and it really made me love biology whereas I never did before.\",\"While the material is interesting, unless it's a requirement, this class is not worth the pain. Expectations are fuzzy all the way through and the workload is manageable but much of it feels like a waste of time.\",\"I will tell them that it is interesting but that it is not particularly well taught for many sections.\",\"I really liked LS1b this year. Apparently, there were a lot of changes made to the class and it seems like it was a lot better this semester. The problem sets, lab reports, GDP question sets, and exams were all reasonable.\",\"It's a good class with interesting material but it has a lot of homework that will often feel unnecessary.\",\"LS1b is challenging and work intensive. But if you put a lot of effort and time into it, you can learn a lot.\",\"If you do the work and love biology, you will actually love this course.\",\"This is one of those courses that you just have to suck it up and take because it is a prerequisite for many other courses. The lectures are very interesting but there is quite a bit of work outside of lecture. You have a problem set and a GDP question set due every Monday and then weekly lab work so just be prepared to put in a lot of time\",\"This class isn't as bad as everyone says, although it is pretty bad. I think going into it with the idea that it was going to be horrible made it worse than it actually was though. There's a lot of work and be prepared to put a lot of time into it, but if you do you can do well on exams and psets. GDP though is a different story, good luck with that. \\r\\nThe lectures\\/material can be interesting so at least there's that.\",\"Its really not as bad as people say, first of all. It's the kind of course that you really just can't let yourself get disenchanted with because of grading\\/GDP or whatever. I worked really hard, learned a lot, and maybe my final grade won't reflect that but oh well-- I'm here at Harvard first and foremost to learn, and I definitely learned a whole lot about biology in a few short months, and I'm proud of myself for that. Take advantage of office hours, PSLs, and the friday problem solving lectures. Go to lecture and read the textbook for Kevin's stuff, especially if you're a bit rusty with bio.
