       "   u'I have actually used things that I learned in this class in my day-to-day life, which is kind of pathetic, but really cool.',\n",
       "   u\"The class trains you to think much more analytically, and is taught very well. The concepts are very practical and overall, you feel like you've learned a lot at the end of it all. However, you must be willing to work hard to do well in this class.\",\n",
       "   u\"It's really hard, and there are many people who think its easy who you have to go up against.\",\n",
       "   u\"too hard, it's about how smart you are and not actually learning something\",\n",

       "   u'The material is not taught at a very high level but is taught very well.',\n",
       "   u'The atmosphere of the course (in lecture, section, and when seeking help with problem sets) left me with the polar opposite of an uneasy feeling.',\n",
       "   u\"It's an excellent course. I'd only recommend it to those with the proper background and those with an interest in the topic. I only had a marginal interest in the material, but the course was so great that I hope to take more stats courses in the future.\",\n",
       "   u\"It's hard, but it's so much fun, and changes the way in which you interpret things around you. Dinner is so much more fun when you can discuss whether the distribution of chocolate chips in your cookies is Poisson.\",\n",
       "   u'This class has its moments, but other times you will probably just regret that even though probability seems simple, appearances can be misleading',\n",
       "   u\"One of the best courses I've taken.\",\n",
       "   u'Very good class with interesting professor. Very difficult however, and does not truly teach the statistical skills that may be needed - instead, it is more of a mathematical introduction to probability rather than any course that teaches statistical methods.',\n",

I think I'll settle for four points:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) The rave: This class is outstanding, probably the most interesting, useful and just...best that I've taken in 5 semesters at Harvard. Joe is fantastic at explaining things, coming up with very challenging, but workable and fascinating problems, and seems to care more about each and every student (both as students and as people) than any other professor I've known. He's very willing to help in office hours, email, etc, and explains things very well. He's also really funny. The TFs are also all super helpful and smart.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) The minor caveat: This class is really hard (approximately 6!/e times harder than Stat 104), and there are a huge number of subtle ways you can go totally astray solving problems. So if you are willing and able to spend the time working through the (fascinating) puzzles, definitely take this class. If not though, you're probably going to be overwhelmed, because this class is very hard. Also, even though the reading is 'redundant' do it anyway; the Degroot book has a different explanation (and examples) than lecture, which helps with understanding the concepts. \\r\\n\\r\\n3) The analogy: If you've taken one of the really easy stat classes (100, 104, etc) then you learned how to operate a machine. Your role is that of a technician operating the arcane procedures of t-tests, statistical significance, Z-scores etc. If you take this class, you will understand how and why those arcane procedures work, and be able to shift from a technician operating a black-box to that of an artist modeling the randomness of our world.\",\n",

That says a lot, especially because this class is very unintuitive and probability is a very difficult subject. Disclaimer, though, just because Joe is really good at explaining doesn't make this class easy -- it was really, really hard, and I'm pretty sure my GPA took a hit for it. I worked really hard on the problem sets but the exams are still really difficult and pretty tricky.

I learned so many useful things from lecture, whereas in most other classes, I leave with the feeling that the information was only applicable for the exams but not in real life. The support from the TF's and the professor was the most amazing part of the course. The TF's were always there to help out with homework and exam review, and their excellent problem and solution sheets enlightened me on so many concepts I didn't grasp at first. Professor Blitzstein is unmatched in his status as my favorite professor of all time (not just at Harvard), and I'm pretty sure no one else is ever going to take that title. His extraordinary patience and understanding encouraged me to continue working hard and improving my understanding of the class despite a disappointing outcome on the midterm. The collection of his famous quotes from lecture is a must read. And lastly, I've never gotten as much candy from any class as I got from this one (yummmmm, chocolate and Haribo gummi bears). Most importantly, take it with your friends. It makes the experience so much more magical! I will always look upon Stat 110 with nostalgia.\",\n",

If you are committed to learning about this stuff, go for it. But be warned that the homeworks can rarely be done alone, and office hours are a zoo. Have I learned some interesting stuff, but at a pretty huge time/effort cost.',\n",

However, the lecture does not really prepare you for the HW, and the HW, although similar in style to the exams, does not really prepare you for the exams (unless one has an extensive math background/is a math genius/has a knack for making mathematical connections, in which case such people probably do well regardless of how the course is taught - so my comments refer primarily to the students who do not fall into this category, which I estimate are 30-50% of the class). The HW is very difficult and tricky so you are left to rely on the TFs to explain how to do it (TF office hours are not office hours in the usual sense but rather a large study group where students do HW together and TFs are available to help). With the average score on exams being around 60% (albeit higher in some years), a large part of the class can't solve even half of the exam problems and are not understanding the material. More of an effort should be made to reach this group. I think this would be very doable in this course with a few modifications since students find the subject fascinating and are eager to learn.\",\n",

I made the mistake of waiting until senior year, and as a result felt unprepared in a number of other courses. And the concepts taught in stat 110 come up in a *lot* of courses. This is probably the most useful course I've taken at Harvard, on par with CS50. In addition to being just plain useful, it really teaches you to think, not just memorize how to do significance tests or something. Joe is the best professor you could ask for. I never thought that stat could be an interesting subject, but he makes it very accessible.

I had a lot of fun in this class, despite that it was quite a challenge. Professor Blitzstein is fantastic, and a very knowledgeable fellow. Take this class if you want a fun challenge. You will feel rewarded at the end.',\n",

       "   u\"Take it if you want to work your ass off, do all the problem sets and strategic practices, and learn a lot.  Don't take it if you're just going to slack off- you'll be doing yourself a grave disservice.  Also, if you do take it, go over the lecture notes once a week and tray all the SP problems and pest problems by yourself first.\",\n",

       "   u\"Don't take this course unless you have 20-30 hours a week. The lectures are pretty good, but the problem sets are ridiculously difficult and so are the exams. Not recommended.\",\n",
       "   u\"The first half is math competition combinatorics, so if you already know this, the only worthwhile part is some interesting problem sets.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe second half covers material that doesn't appear in other places but if you are comfortable with the sort of problem solving from the first, it might be a little slow.\",\n",

       "   u\"If you need to take it, do. Don't pick you concentration specifically to avoid this class. If you don't need to take it, definitely consider whether you have the time necessary to put in. If you're leaning towards a math-heavy concentration (Applied math, stat, math), probably take it, although it will not be easy or terribly enjoyable.\",\n",
       "   u'Very tough but rewarding.  TAKE IT!  Very applicable!',\n",
       "   u\"It's a hard class. The hardest class I have yet taken. Math 21a is definitely a must to have taken the year before. You'll understand change of variables and Markov so much better. However, anyone who's even legitimately interested in probability should take the course. The professor is awesome and has a lot of passion for the topic. Some of the TFs are the most engaging TFs I have seen at Harvard, and they are only undergraduates which kind of puts life in perspective.\",\n",
       "   u\"I've never taken a course quite like this. Each week you may feel stressed on the problem sets; expect to spend a substantial amount of time grappling with the material. However the highs of this class, the 3 a.m. epiphanies, the sense of really understanding the material on an intuitive level, are unmatched by any other course I've taken at Harvard. Fascinating material and Joe is a clear and entertaining lecturer. Stat 110 is something everyone with the slightest interest in quantitative disciplines should take. It'll be worth your while.\",\n",
       "   u'this is a hard but rewarding class',\n",
       "   u'A lot of time and energy is needed to succeed but the teaching staff is great and the material taught is very important',\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is a great course with extremely supportive staff. If you're someone who never goes to section or office hours for classes, you're going to need to make an exception here. Force yourself to go to section and start the homeworks early!!! The homeworks and exams will be quite doable if you stay on top of the class from week to week - that's really all it takes. Your downfall in this class will only be from procrastinating and being lazy. Don't be scared that you're incapable of learning the material, because you really can - there are enough practice problems and sections to help you drill the material into your head. Stat 110 is one of the most well-organized classes at Harvard, definitely take it (if you're willing to put in the work)!!\",\n",
       "   u\"This course teaches you how to think. You actually become smarter and better at problem-solving just by taking it - not just in I learned in Stat 110 to other courses and it's incredible how your ability to discern patterns and find clever shortcuts improves. I would enthusiastically recommend it to everyone, regardless of concentration.\",\n",
       "   u\"Take this class. It's an experience you won't regret. Joe's lectures are fantastic. While the psets and strategic practice are difficult and take time, you can really tell how much work Joe puts into them. They're original and with the course's great support network, you'll get a lot out of them. If you're willing to put in the time and effort, your experience in 110 will be extremely rewarding.\",\n",
       "   u\"Start practice problems early. Do psets early. Listen to last year's lectures.\",\n",
       "   u'This is one of those classes where looking back, I saw how much I learned and really appreciated how when I was taking the final I realized I actually understood things, but during the actual semester I referred to this class as \"the bane of my existence\". This class is no joke, so definitely don\\'t take it on a whim, but if you can suffer through it you realize how cool probability is and how the psets actually teach you a lot. Go to office hours. Seriously. Ask stupid questions. Be prepared to fail the midterm. But this will probably go down as one of my favorite classes at Harvard.',\n",
       "   u\"Take this class if you want to be intellectually stimulated to a degree you probably never experienced. This class will take a huge chunk of your week, and if you put in the work, you'll be rewarded. Be prepared to work harder than you ever did before. Luckily, the topic itself is interesting and even relevant at times. This class embodies the Harvard experience... everybody should try it\",\n",
       "   u'You NEED to set aside a lot of time every week if you want to succeed in this course--make it a priority and do much more than is required of you. If you do so it will be one of the best classes you take at Harvard.',\n",
       "   u'This is a phenomenal, extremely engaging class for anyone with a strong math background as well as an interest in randomness and probability.',\n",
       "   u'Difficult but totally worth it. Office hours are quite helpful!',\n",
       "   u'This class is AWESOME. I know alot people will say it is hard, but it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE. Besides, the challenge makes the class fun, enriching and very enlightening (when you see how stats can be applied in such a rich fashion to situations you would never imagine).',\n",
       "   u\"First of all, contrary to legend, this is an easy course. There are almost 400 students taking it and many are very poor at math, so you can get through with some minimum effort. However, I do not see why anyone would want to take this course. We don't learn much; I've been reading some introductory probability textbooks and I've been learning much more than I did while taking Stat 110. Prof. Blitzstein is really passionate about the material, but fundamentally fails at conveying all his knowledge to the students. It's just a very disappointing experience overall. I don't know much about Math 154, but that course may be a better alternative to taking this course; I recommend future students to shop that class and see whether it is better than Stat 110.\",\n",
       "   u\"So this is a really good course, and there are lots of important things in this course that will help you become a much better thinker, but you really have to make sure you stay on top of things. Like, if you're understanding most of the lectures and at least looking through a few of the strategic practice problems EVERY WEEK then going to multiple sections per week like I wish I'd been doing (and make sure you're finding the right sections for you, some of them are slower and go over lecture material more, whereas others jump right into solving tricky problems). It's a very good class, but sometimes it can be unnecessarily hard or too much work, and the midterm SUCKS.\",\n",
       "   u\"This was by far the best class I have ever taken or am ever likely to take. It's really difficult, and it takes a lot of work, but it leaves you with a whole different sense of looking at how to solve problems. Blitz is incredible as a lecturer, the TFs are all great and enthusiastic, and there is so much support. To complete this class and to feel as though you learned something from it is so rewarding, and I cannot stress enough how much I liked this class. If you don't have time to take it, AT LEAST watch the videos on iTunes. Best decision of college was to take this class.\",\n",
       "   u\"The strategic practices are up there for a reason. Take advantage of them. Start your problem set as soon as it is available on the isites. Take advantage of all of the sections and office hours. All of the TF's are different and thus have different ways of doing things. Finding the person who you are most able to understand will require you to go to more than one section in the first few weeks but it is worth it when you find them. If you don't understand something, spend time trying to understand it. The material is all based upon itself. You'll only be hurting yourself if you don't at least put in the effort to understand something.\",\n",
       "   u'This is an incredibly high level class that, unless you are absolutely ready to put in a ludicrous number of hours in personal preparation, has the potential to overwhelm you.  Proceed with caution, but prepare for an extensive reward if you do succeed.',\n",
       "   u'Very difficult. Requires a lot of time outside of class, i.e. optional sections and office hours.',\n",
       "   u'This is the most ultimate class you will ever take with the most epic professor. Your intuition will be shattered; your mind will be blown; your sleep will suffer. But you will love every minute of it.',\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is extremely difficult, but I feel that I've learned a lot from it. Regardless of what grade you receive, I think that you will come away learning more from this course than pretty much any other.\",\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is a great course that I think everyone should take. A lot of the things we learned in class are very relevant to any concentration. Furthermore Joe's a great lecturer and very passionate about his course. finally this class is very useful for interviews, as many finance interviews often ask statistics questions.\",\n",
       "   u'A great course in the sense that the professor is super enthusiastic and the TFs too. However, it is really tough and time-consuming. If you are not a statistics- or a CS-concentrator, the course can at times be really frustrating.',\n",
       "   u'Very challenging . . . but probably worth it.',\n",

       "   u\"This class is very hard. Be ready to spend over 10 hours per week on P-Sets. Go to office hours and section. You can't over study for the midterm.\",\n",
       "   u'Great class! Hard, but rewarding. Midterm time was the only time I doubted my choice to take the course. Other than that, AWESOME class. I took it with CS61 and it is doable, but requires a lot of effort! If you are like me, prepare to go to office hours both Tuesday and Wednesday nights. Get a pset buddy group--it really helps to see how others think and my group empowered me to think that I could solve the problems on my own without much help. May LOTUS will be your friend. Also, I took this class without a previous Stat background and I took Applied Math 21a concurrently. It was fine. Stat 110 is just awesome.',\n",
       "   u\"This class made me question my life and my choices on a daily basis. It's extremely challenging and you'll learn, but you'll struggle every step of the way. Good luck! :)\",\n",

       "   u\"This course requires a lot of work but it's fun, creative and helpful.\",\n",
       "   u\"Having taken econometrics, stat 104, and stat 107 before this class, I thought that I would be well prepared for Stat 110.  Be forewarned that this class is theoretical math, so nearly no experience with applied statistics helps.  I feel like I wasted at least 15 hours each week outside of class to get problem sets done thinking that they would help with the test.  What it boils down to is that Stat 110 exists to test your prior math skills.  If you come in expecting anything otherwise, this class will be a big frustration and disappointment for you.  Please don't make the same mistake that I did.\",\n",
       "   u\"This class is amazing. Definitely one of the best classes I have taken at Harvard. I never considered myself a Math person, or Statistics person for that matter, but I love this class. It was hard, it was challenging, sometimes I thought I couldn't do it, but with the support of all the TFs and Joe, this class was more than doable. I think everyone should have this kind of knowledge and should not shy away from Stat 110 because of the fact that is hard. I personally took while doing Math 21a in the same semester, and did fine. Probably had to work a little bit more than some other people, but it was worth it in the end. If you really want a life-changing class and are not afraid to work hard, this class is for you. As I said: my preparation was weak, and I still managed to do well.\",\n",
       "   u\"Professor Blitzstein genuinely cares about all of his students and is super accessible outside of class!  This class is a really good introduction to probability.  It doesn't assume much outside knowledge, although a decent background in mathematics is helpful.  That being said, I think that the people who do well come from all different math backgrounds.  In general, this class teaches material that is very interesting and applicable.  It's more about a way of thinking and problem solving than memorizing.  Would definitely recommend this class!\",\n",
       "   u\"Amazing class for anyone willing to work and ready to learn! If you are at all interested in math, and can accommodate it in your schedule balanced with less time-consuming classes then do yourself a huge favor, take on the challenge and be rewarded! It's worth it! \\r\\nFor anyone choosing between Stat 104 or Stat 110, the question comes down to how much you want to learn and how much you want to work so be true to yourself and don't just choose the easy way out if you know you could be fulfilled by the challenge!\",\n",

       "   u\"This class is great, if you are willing to put in the work.  The problem sets are really tough, especially if you miss section that week, and will take a substantial amount of work.  However, the class is challenging in a way that gets you interested in the material and excited when you understand a concept, not frustrated.  the problems are never tedious.  I don't regret taking it and would suggest it to anyone who has the time to take it and wants to get interested in probability.\",\n",

The workload is significant, even if you have a strong math background, but is well balanced and should feel quite reasonable. The material seemed to move rather slowly at first, but don't be fooled you get into some serious maths about a third of the way through and it doesn't let up. In short I highly recommend this course, it will make you a better person.\",\n",

That being said, it is a very difficult course. The type of problems you'll encounter are very different from those you've probably seen before in other math classes (such as calculus). As a result, the problem sets take a lot of time to complete. I'd recommend taking this course in a semester without a lot of other difficult courses, since I personally definitely would have gotten more out of it if I didn't have a ton of other work to do that prevented me from ever looking at the practice problems.\",\n",

I went to two sections each week and suggest you do the same (or more!). It's also important to work with others on the problem sets; office hours are a great place to do this.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou should NOT take this class if you are going to take other hard classes in the same semester.

       "   u\"I was actually thinking of not rating any of my courses, but I think that would have been an injustice - Stat 110 is a great course, hard yes, but you learn a lot - and if that is what truly matters to you even more than just grades, than definitely take the class. The TFs are great - unlike in a lot of classes, the TFs in 110 were clearly chosen with a lot of care. I personally thought the undergrad TFs were by far the most amazing, but you do learn a lot from the grad TFs too. Prof. Blitzstein himself is an incredible professor - everyone says probability can tend to be a dry unintuitive subject, but with his anecdotes and connections, he makes the material massively interesting. He also cares a lot about your learning of the material. I've had great professors and courses, but not quite like Prof. Blitzstein and his Stat 110 course. I struggled quite a bit with the material and while it might come across as hard and unintuitive, definitely stick with it and do heed the course's advice! Start the p-set as early as you can, go to office hours, and do the section problems and Prof. Blitzstein's SP problems. In the end, Stat 110 ended up being my favorite course thus far in college. As for necessary background, do be familiar with partial derivatives, multiple integrals, and matrices - these become especially important later in the course with Jacobian transformations and Markov chains, but the end emphasis is on the statistics and not the calculus. If you are on the fence about taking the class, I would say take it! You can always take it pass/fail if feeling stressed. If you do decide to take it, you're in for a memorably great semester.\",\n",

As always, Jessy's, William's, and Sebastian's sections are spectacular.\",\n",
       "   u\"This is such a great, organized introduction to Statistics.  Blitzstein doesn't teach it in the form of dry, textbook probability but rather exciting examples, all of which show you its applicability to the real world. Blitzstein is just a great person, a great instructor, and he really cares about your success in the class.  He posts hundreds of practice problems and really is accessible to students. Even if you're not considering Statistics as a major, it is a must-take class for anyone quantitative.  Best class I've taken at Harvard, by far.\",\n",
       "   u\"If you're at all quantitative, Stat 110 is a must-take. It synergizes well with literally any other quantitative or non-quantitative field, and it has potentially the best teaching staff of any course that I've taken. Joe is very helpful and great at explaining things. He provides a ton of additional material, which you HAVE to use! It's very helpful and you doing it will be the difference between getting an A or a B. This class was in part responsible for me switching from an Econ to a Stats secondary. No matter what year you are, this class will help you even after college and hopefully will open your eyes to a new and important way of thinking.\",\n",
       "   u'I\\'d put Stat 110 up there with CS50 as one of the \"can\\'t miss\" courses at Harvard. While the material is definitely challenging, you\\'ll never find someone more dedicated to making it manageable and engaging than Professor Blitzstein. The course comes with a built-in support network of great TF\\'s (who put in a lot of time and effort themselves), so don\\'t be intimidated by the difficulty. If you\\'re at all interested in probability and want to learn to think more quantitatively about real-world problems, Stat 110 is for you!',\n",

He cares about Stat110 so much, he is brilliant, engaging, and very accessible as well. Some of the TFs are FANTASTIC as well. If Jessy teaches a section again, go to hers. Her enthusiasm is out of this world. Will and Sebastian also put together a good section, and Will's enthusiasm is great. Sebastian is great too, albeit not as lively as Will.\",\n",
       "   u'Great course but warning if you go in with a strong math background and think it will be a piece of cake.  The course depends as much on memorizing and recognizing famous problems as it does on mathematical ability.  Many other students will put a lot of time into the course so be warned.  A bit too much memorizing towards the end but overall a great course.  It really teaches you how to think about randomness.  Definitely take over 104 or 101.',\n",

If you put in the time and ask for help- you will succeed.\",\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is not an easy course. Of course, since when is anything worthwhile really easy? The concepts covered in lecture are usually pretty understandable, but it's knowing how to recognize patterns (i.e. what concept to apply, where/when to apply it) that really matters. So when Prof. Blitz talks about stories in class, pay attention! It will really help. And also do lots and lots of practice problems--I didn't do nearly enough and it would've helped solidify my understanding of things.\",\n",
       "   u\"This is an amazing class for anyone interested in statistics, probability, or general problem solving. To people who have to take it for concentration credit, I would recommend it strongly. But for people taking it as an elective, I would think twice about putting yourself through this difficult endeavor. It will most likely be the hardest course you take at Harvard. Blitzstein and the TFs do a great job helping you through it and it's always fun doing problem sets with friends.\",\n",
       "   u\"What I'm about to say has been said over and over about this course. It's a really great course that definitely does change the way you think about the world and the things that happen around you. However it is also an extremely hard course. The midterm is brutal - they purposely make it so that you are pushed for time. The final does not have as much time pressure but is still very difficult. I studied for the stat final more than I ever have for any other final and still didn't do as well as I had hoped. However, I have learned a ton from this course and if my GPA didn't take a hit because of this class I would have highly recommended this course without reservations.\",\n",
       "   u\"This class was the hardest class I have ever taken, but I really learned so much and it was really apparent by the end of the term how much I had improved my statistical problem solving skills. As long as you are willing to put in long hours every week completing problem sets that are pretty much impossible to do by yourself and do every single practice problem you can get your hands on before the exams, your hard work will pay off. \\r\\n\\r\\nJessy's section was by far the best, and I'm really lucky to have discovered her so early. She unfortunately won't be TFing the class again next year, which is unfortunate because I know that without her I definitely would have failed the class and gotten discouraged.\",\n",

Joe Blitzstein is an amazing professor and lectures are always engaging and well-attended. I would highly recommend taking this course even as an elective (although it won't be a light one!) If you have the time to put into Stat 110, you will learn so much from it and come out a smarter person.\",\n",

       "   u'Stat 110 is extremely challenging, rigorous, and -- for those reasons -- incredibly rewarding. It demands large amounts of time, up to 15 hours per week in my case, and at times you will feel frustrated. But stick with the course and you will learn a lot. Prof. Blitzstein and the entire teaching staff are not only incredibly helpful but also genuinely dedicated! They make themselves available at every hour of the day. Moreover, you will explore paradoxical, counter-intuitive, and immensely intriguing problems throughout this class.',\n",
       "   u\"If you get it, you get it. If you don't, you'll be playing catch-up all semester long. Get on the strategic practice early, and go to sections if you feel lost. Blitzstein is a great guy, really funny and interesting. His lecture notes can be a bit messy, so make sure you know what's going on. Find a good group of people to work with, because doing the psets yourself is pretty impossible.\",\n",

       "   u\"Stat110 is definitely worth taking, but having done it, I would say it has several notable drawbacks that I would have liked to have known about going into it.  First of all, this course requires a substantial commitment of time, and much of it is spent on pattern memorization and struggling through problem sets.  Secondly, I think it requires a strong conviction that the material is applicable beyond the realm of the course; for me it took reading Nate Silver's book mid-semester to get through.  Lastly, I think it's a course that's easy to stress over, and ultimately it's the type of class for which worrying about grades is not beneficial.  All that being said, I think Professor Blitzstein puts a lot of effort into making the course provide the background necessary for more advanced work in stats, and the attention he pays to it is probably its greatest redeeming quality.\",\n",
       "   u'No matter how many people have said this already, Stat 110 will change the way you think. You will get a huge amount of support for the sometimes very hard psets, and right when you are starting to regret taking it, Professor Blitzstein will do something to make you happy you did!',\n",

       "   u'This is the best course I have taken at Harvard. It was very challenging, and I definitely underestimated how hard it would be. The material is quite different from anything I (or most students) have studied before, but once I had a firm grasp of the fundamentals, I felt that the course was organized in a way that really took advantage of that strong foundation and taught me a lot about probability. This class motivated me to get a Stat secondary.',\n",

Still worth learning how to do these kinds of problems - they're quite interesting - but you can make it through the whole course while barely going to lecture. Probably a good fifth class. Don't be frightened off by the workload ratings, try it for yourself and see.\",\n",
       "   u\"Absolutely one of Harvard's BEST courses. If you enjoy math and are interested in probability, this course will enlighten you with a lot of really cool results. There's so much to learn, but you will feel very accomplished at the end. There's a reason why so many students are now choosing/switching to statistics as their concentration.

However, the applications and skills you learn from this class will probably be more useful and applicable in various fields of life than most other classes you take at Harvard. Joe, the professor, is extremely passionate about the subject, and is quite infectious in his love for the subject. Be sure to go to office hours and sections!!\",\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is a well-oiled machine... it's been one of the best classes I've taken at Harvard. Joe Blitzstein's lectures are very well-planned, and manage to provide both mathematical and intuitive understanding of all the material. A good TF will make or break your experience... problem sets can be extremely daunting if you don't go to office hours, yet if you do, you should be able to do them without toiling away for too long. I don't know how strongly I'd recommend this class to freshmen, unless you are already comfortable with the foundations of higher-level math... plenty of upperclassmen take it. Having taken it as a junior, I found all of the material extremely accessible and relatable to other things I've studied. In short, TAKE IT TAKE IT TAKE IT.\",\n",

Material is absolutely fascinating-- when you are studying for the final you will see that everything you've learned over the course of the semester fits together in beautiful ways. Psets get tiring but that's pretty much the case in any pset class.

I feel much more equipped for brain-teasers after this course.  Also, Blitzstein is an awesome professor (what do you expect?  He is a techer).',\n",
       "   u\"This course should be required for all freshmen, seriously. I can not emphasize enough how enjoyable, useful, interesting, and well-taught this course is. The subject material is immediately applicable to so many things: I found myself using what I learned in Stat 110 in my research lab, in my other courses, and in my daily life. If you want to feel smarter and be smarter, you should take this course! Furthermore, the course is taught extremely well: the lectures are terrific, the teaching staff really does care, and the course's materials (practice problems, homework assignments, practice exams, etc.) are abundant, accurate, and helpful. Also, the way in which the material is taught, with a heavy emphasis on telling stories and finding patterns, and a smaller emphasis on memorizing equations, is very effective and will help you absorb the material better. The course is challenging, no doubt. I have quite a bit of background in math, but still found every problem set difficult (but doable, nonetheless). Be prepared to go to office hours every week and spend 5+ hours on each problem set. Definitely find a group of students to work with, because that will make them go much quicker. Also be prepared to feel depressed after taking the midterm, because it is really hard and really fast! But it helps you figure out what you need to work on. I am quite comfortable saying that this has been the best course I have taken at Harvard yet. And I'm a junior. Professor Blitzstein treats this course like his baby: he really really wants to do it well, and he definitely succeeds! Harvard, please give him a huge raise, because he really deserves it. He spends entire weekends writing problem sets and exams, and personally reading through midterm re-writes. That's how much he cares!\",\n",

That being said, they can be pretty brutal sometimes (as pre-meds, unfortunately, often are), so beware, and don't let any foul rejections are indifference get you down, buddy. There's always someone out there who you'll dig and who will be down. You're awesome in your own right. Unless you're one of the brutal people - then stop, check yourself, and just stop being so rotten, man/girl. I love you anyway. Wait, my bad, I gotta write about this ish. Let me toke up really quickly first.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlright cool, so this class. Blitzstein is an incredible professor at 2x speed, but just a phenomenally intelligent and lucid turtle in real time. So download that fancy CS50 plugin and just start watching the videos, if you're down with that kind of learning. If you need to go to lecture in person, they'll still be really helpful, and much funnier, but they'll be as slow as we are in this relativistic universe. But yea, Blitzstein is one funny homie. He'll drop these humorous comments out of nowhere that'll make the whole lecture worth you waking up before 3 pm (I don't know if that's a problem for you too). Should you not take it if he's not teaching it? If you can put it off, then put it off, without a doubt. If you can't put it off, then make sure his textbook is still being used, because that book is straight FIIIIIIRE as far as textbooks go. I mean, it's like the Madvillainy of textbooks. He's got so many examples and he doesn't get caught up in any semantics, and never really wastes your time. If you're good enough with the material, you can get through the class with just that book. The TFs... damn, I don't really know anything about them. Sorry. However, William does make an ill cheat sheet for the final, so he seems pretty chill. The p-sets are really fun to do (and by that I mean like a 3 on a scale of 1 to Super Smash Bro with beer), especially if you do them with friends and/or a potential suitor (please see first paragraph). The exams can MESS YOU UP though, so be careful. They're not that hard, but a slip-up or two can cost you big points, so just breathe and focus.

If you're unsure about the workload it is manageable, but maybe don't take it if you have a heavy schedule. Go to office hours and section. Every week. It's very easy to fall behind in this class, particularly after the midterm if you don't have a very technical background in math, not that it ever gets that math-y, so don't let yourself fall behind. But overall this course was amazing. Read the textbook, if you use Blitzstein's during his year off. It was such an undervalued asset but it's so incredibly useful for problem sets exams and general understanding. Has excellent examples.\",\n",

       "   u'I was pretty disappointed in STAT 110, given its towering reputation and Blitz\\'s obviously strong teaching skills. I\\'m a graduate student in the social sciences and was hoping that this course would help to ground some of the applied stats that we use on a regular basis. While it did give me quite a bit of rigorous understanding of general concepts in probability, I thought that the course spent way too much time on minute details that only mattered to the small proportion of the class that is going to end up doing graduate work in math and statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nI think there needs to be a probability and statistics course in the stat department that\\'s better geared toward social science grad students. Not *so* mathematics-driven as 110, but not *so* applied that the math is totally gone. My sense from my peers is that there would be huge demand for such a class, and I think Blitz would be a great prof for it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI don\\'t recommend that soc science grad students take 110: it\\'s far too difficult in areas that really don\\'t matter to us in the long run, which I think makes it a very frustrating experience. It\\'s also a quintessentially \"Harvard Undergrad\" course with some questionable pedagogic decisions, especially with respect to psets & office hours. Many of the undergrads swarm the TF office hours and essentially get answers from them -- I\\'ve got problems with this from an academic integrity perspective and my [entirely biased, yes] hunch is that grad students are less comfortable with this kind of behavior than are undergrads.',\n",
       "   u'Having the textbook makes the lectures somewhat redundant, but they are still worth attending.  Also, take advantage of the practice problems.',\n",
       "   u'If you did competition math in High School, you will have a much easier time with this class. You\\'ll already have a lot of the \"intuition\" needed for solving these kinds of problems. I know this from speaking with people who did competition math. \\r\\n\\r\\nUnfortunately, I was not one of those people. I came into Harvard taking Math 1b-- none of that Math 23/25 business for me. The problems in this class are very hard if you haven\\'t seen anything like them before. In most math classes (at least at the 21 level), the problems will make it somewhat obvious which technique they want you to use. In this class, it\\'s not obvious at all, and so you need to develop \"intuition\" for when to use which techniques as well as how to apply them. This means you need to really understand the material you learn. Understand what different distributions mean. Understand the theorems as well as their implications. Read the textbook. Most importantly, do practice problems. I should have done more of this. Go out of your way to do extra problems-- Professor Blitzstein provides them for every unit plus solutions.\\r\\n\\r\\nThat being said, this course changed the way I think. It gave me a glimpse into the world of problem-solving by helping me be able to distill new problems down to their bare bones, at which point the required technique becomes far clearer. I learned how tricky probability is, and I filled in all of the gaps I had left over from my minimal high school lessons on the subject. If probability has been a sticking point for you, take this. If you want to get better at solving problems, take this. It may be painful, but as you move through it you\\'ll start to realize how altered your thinking process has become. You\\'ll become sharper. You\\'ll have a more intuitive sense for what things mean, and you\\'ll be able to explain things better because of this. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo definitely take this course. Professor Blitzstein is EXCELLENT at explaining things, cares a lot about the class and really wants his students to do well. He moves slowly in lecture so he\\'s easy to follow, and if it\\'s too slow for you then you can download the CS50 2x video speed plugin and watch him on 1.5x or 2x speed.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlso, go to Section and Office Hours. The TFs are helpful, and at office hours the students are helpful too. It\\'s nice if you can find a solid friend group in the class to work with on some nights (I did this by going to office hours and discovering that people I sortof knew were in the class). I also met some new people. So if you need help, Office Hours is definitely the way to go.\\r\\n\\r\\nLastly, make sure to ask questions when they come up. Do not let things go unanswered, because they will come back to haunt you over and over and over again. Overall this was a great class. Definitely the hardest I\\'ve taken so far, but worth it.',\n",

       "   u'This is one of those rare courses that really teach you a novel cognitive toolkit: not just content or domain-general thinking skills but a particular kind of thinking. It is, as everyone warns, a lot of work. For grad students taking this course, who may not be coming in with \\xe2\\u20ac\\u0153AP calculus\\xe2\\u20ac\\x9d (whatever that is), some important observations: the algebra and calculus knowledge assumed is serious, at least for the examples and homework--though pleasantly, the tests require relatively little of those things. I\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122m not sure I passed yet but, I did learn a lot in this course despite being very underprepared mathematically. So it\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122s possible. But it\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122s frustrating when what\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122s standing between you and understanding an example is following the algebra. So if you are thinking of taking this having only sketchy math background, prepare for major feelings of helplessness and failure. Also, the homework basically assumess you will collaborate with others and spend hours in dining halls in TF hours. However, it is apparently possible to have extraordinarily low homework grades (I never saw any grades lower than mine on any single homework\\xe2\\u20ac\\xa6) and score about average on the tests. Also, one strategy that really helped me was doing section problems on my own and checking solutions. Going to section is like giving yourself 30s to try the problem before seeing the solution, which goes by too quickly anyway, so much less helpful. I don\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122t at all blame the TFs for this, as they are forced to do this by the sheer number of problems they have to get through\\xe2\\u20ac\\u201din fact their section problems are really great.

       "   u\"It's a bit of a pain to learn the material without going to lecture. The book is rather good, although it's easier to absorb when it's being told to you. That being said, as awesome as this class was, Blitzstein isn't a great lecturer... I find him to be very boring to listen to. It's very difficult to not fall asleep in his class.\",\n",
       "   u\"If you're going to attempt to understand the material (which, let's be real, most people who take the class never will, to the point where there are NO STUDENTS who feel competent enough to tutor in the class, even those who got As don't understand the material) then you need to take it over the summer or have the rest of your classes be gen-eds. It's possible to scrape a C+/B- with minimal effort in the class, but to get anything higher than that you really have to commit your semester. It is also really depressing because when you don't understand something, it seems like no on is willing to answer your stupid questions, and the stuff you don't know just keeps building. This class is trying to be cultish the same way CS50 is, but the reality is there just isn't much love toward the students, and instead, it's very intense and competitive.\",\n",
       "   u\"I made the mistake of taking this course along with two other pset classes, all of which had Friday due dates. This made for a very challenging semester and some very late and stressful nights. This course in particular was very time intensive. The nature of the problems is such that you cannot simply sit down and crank through the homework in one evening. You need to start early so you have time to really think through and most likely, completely redo at least several problems before you're done. Find good pset buddies and talk through the concepts with them. Before the midterm and final there is a plethora of review material. It is incredibly overwhelming at first, but take a deep breath and start working through the problems. The more practice problems you do, the better prepared you will be. Buy the course pack/textbook when it gets published. With Blitzstein teaching, you really don't need to go to lecture as long as you religiously read the sections, since they are basically his lecture notes. There are also a lot of extra problems in there.\",\n",

It's unclear why course instruction does not include demonstrations of problems as difficult as those that will appear on exams, and why so little energy is devoted to training students how to solve problems. Judging by the breadth of topics and question difficulty in the previous exams (which were provided as practice material), topics covered have become more numerous and questions have become more difficult over the last 6 years.\",\n",

It takes up more time than you might anticipate, even if you're good at this sort of thing, so if you have a busy schedule be prepared for an all-nighter almost every Thursday.

Also know that 110 is by far the superior course (coming from someone who's taken both). 104 is basically a joke, and 110 really does teach you a different way of thinking about the world and probabilities of events. Absolutely take Stat 110. Honestly, it's not all that hard.\",\n",

The organization of content in this class is THE BEST I've seen in a quantitative class at Harvard (I'd say even better than the oh-so-well-greased CS50, and more conceptually rewarding as well). Psets are well set, interesting, and manages to strike a good balance between forcing you to think and being impossibly hard.

The lectures, problem sets, and book work together very well, and there are many resources for assistance, from TFs to Quora to Blitzstein's helpful emails. To conclude, I reommendend this class to any person in a quantitative field!\",\n",

The problem sets are nearly impossible to do on your own, and you often need to work with other students and get a lot of help from TFs (which is available) to get the problem sets done well. That being said, this class is certainly doable. I wish I had kept up with the topics more actively throughout the semester. I think that would have made the class easier. The thing is, the concepts are inherently difficult. It is tough to master these topics no matter how many times you re-watch the lectures or how much you listen in class; you really have to be willing to put in a lot of extra time to actually learn the concepts. I struggled with this class a lot. To be honest, without it the semester would have been so much smoother. However, in the end, I\\'m happy I took the class. It\\'s cool to have made it through it, and I believe that I have stronger reasoning and thinking skills. I feel more prepared to deal with problem solving in my other classes. In a way, I would say this class made me smarter, or at least a better thinker. Now, a lot of people will say it was life-changing (or that is at least what I read when I tried to figure out if I should take the class). I don\\'t think this class changed my life to any major extent besides causing some stress, but it certainly challenged me and made me more determined than I had ever been to try and understand such a difficult class. Take this class if you want to be pushed. Make use of office hours, sections, and every other resource if you want to do well. And, go in with an open mind and no expectations in order to keep yourself sane. This review isn\\'t meant to scare anyone. This class is not as \"terrible\" as people will say.

The aspect of the course I found most interesting is that the solutions to most of the interesting questions we discuss/solve on psets/solve on midterm and final rely on symmetries that you need to find in the problem. This is a powerful tool, but at times it felt like a crutch, in that solutions would rely on symmetries without explaining why those symmetries were actually there. This is problematic because a lot of results in probability are counter-intuitive. Thus, when solving a problem, I often found myself thinking \"well, if I assume this symmetry then the problem maps nicely onto a problem we already solved, which is usually how these sorts of problems go. I see that this symmetry could potentially exist, but I also see arguments against this symmetry.\" Unfortunately, I did not feel adequately armed to decide when symmetries actually existed or not, because we discussed symmetries as they came up in problems instead of treating symmetry as a topic to study in and of itself. A bit more emphasis on finding symmetries, however, would make the course much better IMHO.',\n",

While it's possible to go to a bunch of office hours and figure out all the answers out there, looking back, I would recommend reading the relevant chapter in the book thoroughly and doing the relevant strategic practice problems on the course website before attempting each problem set. It's time consuming, but that way you'll actually understand the material and will be in good shape for the midterm and final.

It's a testament to Joe that 6-7 problems a week can really make you understand the curriculum.  The midterm and final are very similar in style to previous ones, so doing the old ones definitely helps.  William and Sebastian are the bomb and clearly very dedicated to the course.  The only issue is I don't think either of them or Joe will be around next year.  Overall, a fantastic course that definitely is very very challenging.

I often spent more time trying to evaluate an integral correctly than setting up the problem/applying the relevant statistical concepts. Moreover, while the first third of the course was taught with story proofs, the last two thirds of the course taught material in (what felt like) a less elegant way. I never went to section, but I went to office hours a couple times, and the TFs were very helpful with clearing up any areas of confusion. Other supplemental material (extra practice problems, practice midterms, and practice exams) were available. In general, though, this course wasn't difficult.

Kevin somehow turned a theoretical class into an applied class, which is sort of impossible given the subject. Kevin's lectures were absolutely awful and unhelpful. If it weren't for Joe's textbook, I don't think I would know a single thing about probability. It often seemed like Kevin himself didn't even understand the theory behind probability. One TF who really picked up Kevin's slack was Ryan Lee. Ryan's sections were so well-attended (And with good reason! Ryan actually taught us the material that we never learned elsewhere) that they had to be held in a lecture hall. If that's not a sign that this class has major problems, I don't know what is. The problem sets were also unreasonably difficult. Kevin even said that they were meant to be too difficult to do alone without TF help. That seems absurd! We're not really learning the material if we have to ask TFs to walk us through the problem sets each week. Kevin also did not give the TFs solutions to the problem sets, so two different TFs could lead you to two very different problem set answers. The exams were also ridiculously challenging and demoralizing. Especially because we couldn't solve the problem sets on our own, doing an exam on our own was incredibly difficult. This was one of the most brutal experiences I have ever had at Harvard. Somehow I still plan to concentrate in Statistics even after this disaster of a class (a decision that is based on the other classes I have taken in the department, which have been much, much better), but I now never want to take another class based on probability or randomness. Perhaps this class is better with Joe Blitzstein at the helm. But with Kevin Rader teaching this class, this is definitely a class you should run far, far away from.

To really learn a topic, find some straight-forward practice problems online (just Google \"[topic name] solved problems\"), drill those problems, then do the problems from the book then the homework problems. Make sure you take the time to learn the math notation and keywords used in the book. This can be done with a small amount of Googling as well. Symmetry is a bit of an elusive topic, but make sure you get a grip on that right away. Note that symmetry appears when dealing with distributions (e.g. the Normal) as well as random variables (e.g. iid random variables). Be sure that you can do every example in the text-portion of the book on your own. Also note that homework problems are fair game for exams, so do not just do the homework, hand it in, and forget about it. Be sure you can redo any homework problem after you have handed it in.

Problem sets start easy but escalate very quickly, and exams are difficult. That said, the class is rewarding and really impacts how you think about the world, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't have an extra-challenging schedule already outside of this class and is interested in cool paradoxes, coincidences, thinking about things mathematically, and can put in the time to learn the theoretical parts well.\",\n",

Everything about it is simply amazing, but the thing that stands out the most is the focus on problem solving, and on intuition rather than brute computation (with only minimal sacrifices of mathematical rigor). This makes the class fun and enjoyable. As for difficulty, I think that if you have a high school contest math background (e.g. AMC/AIME) this will be a relatively painless extension of those concepts. But I have many friends who took the course without such a background and still found it very manageable- especially since you're allowed to drop 2 homeworks, and each homework is a consistent and very fair 7 problems. Also, I think having a good conceptual understanding of calculus (distinct from just knowing how to take derivatives and integrals) will make this class seem much more natural and straightforward, although it is not strictly necessary to do well in the course since again the emphasis is on intuition, not calculation. There's also a wealth of resources for help, from the extremely well-written textbook (which is essentially a carbon copy of this course since Blitzstein wrote it!) to the wonderful TFs who hold an inordinate number of sections and office hours every week. Highly recommend this class to anyone, and I loved it so much that I really want to TF it next year!\",\n",

Psets are very difficult, and you will need help from TFs or fellow students to complete them. If you don't keep up with lecture and learn the material on your own, you will absorb very little and be unprepared for the difficult exams.

       "   u\"not as hard as people say. if you've taken Math 21a, this is pretty comparable in difficulty. it's conceptually easier, though, and with less tedious calculation. and way more interesting.\",\n",
       "   u'Extremely important class for any quantitative/scientific major. The material in Stat 110 is applicable to almost anything. Physics majors, for example, should definitely take this class. The course is not terribly demanding, and very rewarding if you work diligently to understand the material.',\n",
       "   u'Put in the hours. It will be super worth it.',\n",
       "   u\"It's a very challenging class even thought it's supposed to an introductory level course. The material is incredibly interesting and what you get out of the course really depends on how much time you put into it. Professor Blitzstein is a great lecturer and is great at breaking down complex concepts and providing intuition behind a lot of the hard statistical problems. The TFs are a great resource and I generally have a very positive experience during sections and office hours.\",\n",
       "   u\"This class is difficult but rewarding. It's not to be taken lightly. Psets get harder every week, and be prepared to spend 10+ hours on the course each week. Reading the textbook helps immensely but practicing questions is the best way to understand the concepts and how to apply them.\",\n",
       "   u\"TAKE THIS CLASS! Probability is way more fundamental than learning how to do T-tests and make confidence intervals (which is what you'd be doing in Stat 100 and the like). The Pset problems are never what they seem at first, so make sure you spend lots of time on them and check with others at office hours. This class has one of the best textbooks, because it tracks closely with what is done in lecture and includes lots of useful examples.\",\n",
       "   u\"This class is hard. You have to put in a lot of time and effort so unless you are doing this for your concentration, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you have to take it, Blitzein is a great teacher\",\n",
       "   u'This is class is extremely hard. Do the psets, study at least a week in advance for the midterm. Do not get behind. Utilize the book and office hours they are helpful. Finally. The strategic practice problems are a great way to study.',\n",
       "   u'Interesting material, good lectures, good problem sets. Overall a great class.',\n",
       "   u'It is a difficult course, and with the dropped homework policy it is easy to skip homeworks, but this will be bad once an exam rolls around. Start the psets very early.',\n",
       "   u'Great class, definitely makes you work hard and learn the concepts which are applicable to almost anything',\n",
       "   u\"Stat 110 is a fun and good course, with some trickiness on exams. Even if you do all of the work and have a good handle on probability, it is possible to do more poorly, because the examples are pretty tough sometimes, especially under time pressure. Don't get lazy! Thank the Based God and Big Joe for make this course fun. Probability is a really beautiful, fun and counterintuitive subject that will make you think in a completely new way. If you are a sophomore, it is likely that many of your friends will take this course, which is also a lot of fun.\",\n",
       "   u'Most people will find this class to be very difficult. It is well staffed and there are abundant resources at your disposal; nonetheless, this class is still a monster. Expect to spend on average 10 hours a week on problem sets and at office hours. Find people to work with, and develop a solid way to study for the exams.',\n",
       "   u'Probability is actually the coolest concept, and Blitzstein does a fantastic job teaching. If you love math, take this course.',\n",
       "   u\"This class was terrrrrrrible. If you don't need to take it don't. If you do need to take it don't. It's pretty tough and even though one can do well on the homework by going to office hours, it doesn't feel good. There is a ton of material presented in a very short amount of time which makes it difficult to feel like you actually know what you are doing. I do feel like I learned many probability ideas, but a lot of it came from teaching myself by the book. It definitely wasn't an enjoyable experience because even though you see a lot of new ideas you don't really see how to apply them. There are many many ways to learn probability. This class was not the way.\",\n",
       "   u'Work hard in this class! I also would recommend making this your hardest class of the semester, because it will take up a lot of time. I would also suggest going to section once a week (or more if you need it) and office hours as much as possible!',\n",
       "   u\"It's hard.\",\n",
       "   u'Very hard, but very rewarding when putting in the work.',\n",
       "   u'Be ready for a heck of a class. Great lectures, but very difficult problem sets sometimes paired with what seemed like unfair examinations based on how good your cheat sheet is rather than how much you know combined to make some aspects of the class seem out of reach.',\n",
       "   u\"WOW. Joe is a legend, obviously. Cares greatly about the material and has created an amazing environment to learn about a very difficult topic. Can't believe I made it through this class, but I can say I came out with a different way of thinking compared to when I started Stat 110. Take this class if you are ready to be challenged and think abstractly. NOT for the faint of heart. Conditioning is the SOUL of statistics.\",\n",
       "   u'The class is fascinating and Joe is fantastic, but it is very very hard.  As a fall semester freshman who only took BC calc, I recommend waiting until you have at least math 21ab under your belt before you attempt this class because a strong math background is really important for this class.',\n",
       "   u'Stat 110 taught me a whole new paradigm for problem solving. Uncertainty is ubiquitous and Stat 110 will give you the necessary framework to understand it. The course is difficult, but is extremely doable if you have the requisite math background and a willingness to put in the time to understand the key concepts.',\n",
       "   u'be ready to dedicate yourself wholeheartedly to this course',\n",
       "   u'Difficult but worth it',\n",
       "   u\"It's a very interesting course but be prepared to spend a lot of your own time figuring out the assignments and the concepts.\",\n",
       "   u'Pacing yourself and attending lecture/section makes the class much more manageable!',\n",
       "   u'Great class! Learn a lot. Be prepared to do the work though, and it helps to have a pset group.',\n",
       "   u'A hard class, but take it because of the awesome professor teaching it!',\n",
       "   u'This is a great course all around. Joe is a very dedicated and effective professor. There are a lot of materials available to help outside of class in office hours, extra problems, and more. This course is definitely one of the hardest at Harvard. The exams cover a lot of material, so make sure to prepare a few days in advance.',\n",
       "   u'Some material is challenging but the core concepts are so thoroughly and well though that even if you \"don\\'t do well\" in this course, you will have learned the fundamental basics of probability and a bit more. I recommend this course to anyone doing anything vaguely related to math or science.',\n",
       "   u'The material in this class is cool. As someone with a strong math background however, I found the class rather slow and boring at times. Regardless, it covers a wide range of topics.',\n",
       "   u\"This class is hard. It doesn't seem like it's going to be hard, but then it suddenly is. I made the mistake of taking this with two other extremely demanding courses and I paid the price. Be warned that just doing well on the problem sets won't necessarily be enough to teach you the concepts, and you should do problems on your own, go to section, etc.\",\n",
       "   u\"It's hard but it's worth it.  Start the psets early.  Tests are pretty fair, nothing too unexpected.  Go to section.  Find friends to work on psets with.\",\n",
       "   u\"Oh my god this class was hard. The exams were scary, the psets gave me anxiety each week. But put in a lot of work and you'll do fine... I mean a lot of work. Like, more work than you're used to putting in for stuff.\",\n",
       "   u\"stat110 op\\r\\ntf's are gods, make sure to attend someone's section and it will be enormously helpful\\r\\noffice hours as where you get to talk to gods. Take advantage of them!!\",\n",
       "   u\"This is a phenomenal class; best I've taken at Harvard. It's a lot of work but really rewarding; looking back it's amazing how much you learn over the semester. Blitzstein is an incredible professor, makes statistics engaging, and just wrote his textbook to really back up the lectures well.\",\n",
       "   u\"It's okay.\",\n",
       "   u'Should have an interest in strategic or probabilistic thinking, willingness to put in around 10-14 hours per week',\n",
       "   u'This course provides a very strong foundation in probability for students in almost any realm of natural science and social science.',\n",
       "   u\"It's a difficult course, and I wouldn't recommend taking it with other hard classes.\",\n",
       "   u'This is a very difficult course, but Professor Blitzstein is great.',\n",
       "   u\"Class is hard if the logic and mentality of statistics doesn't come easily to you, and for me it certainly didn't.  That being said, if you work at it and try your best to understand the material it is very rewarding for everything to start making sense.  The p-sets are hard and time consuming and you should start working on them earlier.  One flaw of the course that it unavoidable is that office hours are very crowded and people are somewhat aggressive.  As a result, I really tried my best not to go to them.  Likewise, I would really recommend struggling with the problems first instead of just directly heading to office hours.\",\n",
       "   u\"Not easy, but the quality of teaching and available resources are so excellent that you can't blame anybody but yourself if you don't succeed. Very solid course, applicable to a wide variety of areas and life in general. Highly recommend.\",\n",
       "   u\"Don't take this class unless you can fully commit to it. Be prepared to be let down by your test scores\",\n",
       "   u'Such a great class! it is notoriously hard but the material is so interesting! Keep up with the material, go to lecture, go to section, go to OFFICE HOURS and you will be fine. OH are great and people are really good at working together.',\n",
       "   u'go to office hours',\n",
       "   u'Very good class with great teaching, resources, and problem sets. Workload can get a bit heavy after halfway point, as the problem sets get difficult. The midterm and final exam are also pretty difficult, requiring a solid grasp of all the material covered (which is quite a bit).',\n",
       "   u'Very difficult, but rewarding class! Take it if you think you have the time for it!',\n",
       "   u\"it's rlly difficult\",\n",

       "   u\"Stat 110 was my favorite course this fall. Blitztein is a great lecturer and really cares about his students learning the material. I'm impressed with how many resources he provides (the textbook, the strategic practice problems, the massive midterm and final review packets with half a dozen previous exams, etc.) -- basically, if you don't do well in this course, it's entirely your fault. I really enjoyed Stat 110 although I know some who found it more theoretical and mathy than what they expected. I didn't find this to be the case - there are plenty of pset problems that have real-world applications. I recommend this course with enthusiasm to all who want an introduction to statistics (if you've taken calculus).\",\n",
       "   u'Stat 110 is a truly rewarding class. If you know single variable calc, do take this class. Be prepared to work hard and be thorough when preparing for exams, which are tough.',\n",

Stats is useful across all kinds of disciplines - even if you're apprehensive about your background, you'll be among friends and the course staff is very helpful in office hours. Blitzstein's lectures can get dry, but that's what lecture videos and the textbook are for.\",\n",

       "[u'Make sure you are very comfortable with high school and 21a level calculus. Make sure you understand functions (they are more nuanced than people realize) and infinite series (which people tend to forget after the AP). Know that there are very good materials available online to supplement Professor Blitzstein\\'s book. State colleges have a lot of material freely available. To really learn a topic, find some straight-forward practice problems online (just Google \"[topic name] solved problems\"), drill those problems, then do the problems from the book then the homework problems. Make sure you take the time to learn the math notation and keywords used in the book. This can be done with a small amount of Googling as well. Symmetry is a bit of an elusive topic, but make sure you get a grip on that right away. Note that symmetry appears when dealing with distributions (e.g. the Normal) as well as random variables (e.g. iid random variables). Be sure that you can do every example in the text-portion of the book on your own. Also note that homework problems are fair game for exams, so do not just do the homework, hand it in, and forget about it. Be sure you can redo any homework problem after you have handed it in. Most of all: do not slack off and do not be intimidated. Just be prepared.',\n",

       " u\"The lectures aren't bad, but the book explains things more precisely, and reading the book takes less time.  The book is basically a replication of the lectures, so it has all the info necessary to do well in the course.\",\n",
       " u'This is a great course and great teacher (Blitzstein), is you are interested in statistics definitely you have to take it, if not, you should also take, you will learn a lot or probability and statistics and the most important part is that you will enjoy every lecture.',\n",

       " u\"Read the textbook and do practice problems.  If/WHEN you need help ask for it!  I think to be fair to the material and yourself, you need to devote time, and a lot of it, to gain understanding on the topics covered. You need to read the textbook and attend/watch lectures because stat 110 is all about theory, and you need to do practice problems to learn how to apply this stuff to answering questions - which is what tests are. We all have busy schedules, and speaking for myself, I did not think I had any time that I could've spent doing more stat, but looking back now I would go back and FIND that time.  Stat 110 is daunting, but you can get through it and you cannot be afraid of asking for help.\",\n",
       " u'The class is very difficult. Reach out to the staff and your peers.',\n",
       " u\"Even though I definitely did not do this class very well, it's still amazing nonetheless. The material is a lot of fun, and the course is run extremely well. Blitzstein is very good about providing lots of resources, and since he writes all the problem sets and tests, there's a centralized authority for issues.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a great class! The material can be tricky at times, but I learned so much, and Joe is a really great teacher. Exams are definitely easier than problem sets (because the purpose of the problem sets is to get you to think about the material and collaborate with others, not to test you), so don't let problem set difficulty discourage you from taking the course. Exam problems all tend to be very similar to example problems done in class, so as long as you really understand those problems you should be fine.\",\n",

Just stay on top of everything and do as much practice as you can. I probably wouldn't recommend if you are just looking for a taste of statistics- its pretty comprehensive.\",\n",
       " u'This class could not be better taught. Blitzstein strikes the optimal difficulty level in problem sets, challenging but very realistic given the material covered in lecture. He wrote his own book (a textbook I will definitely keep) so the class is incredibly well paced and makes you recognize the beauty of statistics.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe problem sets are difficult, but in the \"i cant wait to figure this out\" sense, not the feeling that you are underprepared. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou\\'ll walk away from this class realizing how much you can learn and how fun it can be.',\n",

Don\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122t be scared off either - this class covers a lot of material, but it\\xe2\\u20ac\\u2122s definitely manageable if you put in the time and make sure to keep up with understanding why things work the way they do, rather than trying to get by with pattern-matching.',\n",

       " u\"This course was pretty much what I expected. Very hard -- I couldn't complete the problem sets alone -- but definitely worth the work, and I think my problem solving skills and intuition about probability have developed a lot. When you're done with the course, it really feels like you've accomplished something/gone to hell and back. Blitzstein is a great professor, too.\",\n",
       " u\"Take this class.  But be forewarned that you need to either have a strong probability background or spend a lot of time to succeed.  Also know that while Joe likes to say that he's not focusing on the calculus, and the course does emphasize conceptual learning, you will have a lot of trouble if you don't feel very comfortable on the algebra/calculus of it.\",\n",
       " u\"Difficult course but go for it! You learn so much, and it is extremely rewarding. Make sure to start HWs early and go to office hours! Don't be too intimidated- just know it will take some investment of time.\",\n",
       " u'Will take a good amount of effort to remember and comprehend later material but will definitely be worth it to gain the ability to apply that material to real world problems and scenarios.',\n",
       " u\"A challenging but extremely rewarding course. The course has numerous resources (strategic practices, practice exams, office hours) to ensure that you understand the material. If you put in the work, it's relatively manageable to get a good grade.\",\n",
       " u'While this has been marketed in Harvard culture as a \"must take\" class, for non stat/math concentrators, I would recommend watching a few lecture online first to really get the feel before signing on. I have no regrets taking the course, but do feel it was overhyped.',\n",
       " u'You will have to work extremely hard to do well in this class, but if you really like probability you will enjoy it.',\n",
       " u'It is hard. It is not as fun as I thought it would be. You should do practice problems every week. The homework is SO LONG EVERY SINGLE WEEK. But the book is amazing and you learn very useful stuff. It is a class you should take, like it or not, and it is by no means a class you will hate, you might just not love it.',\n",
       " u\"Great class that really pushed me to think in a different way! Stat110 may seem scary -- I was definitely nervous at the beginning -- but it was very fulfilling. There are SO many resources -- 8 practice exams for every final, and a textbook that directly matches what we're learning in lecture, with the same problem examples. It didn't end up being as time consuming as I thought it would be -- while the problem sets are hard, office hours are very helpful and it's fun (and more efficient) to work with other people. Overall, great class and would highly recommend!\",\n",
       " u'I would definitely recommend this course to anybody who is willing to spend the time and effort into learning this material. However, Stat110 should be taken as the \"one hard course\" for the semester, as it is difficult to manage the workload and keep up with the material if you are also taking other classes of similar difficulty. The class moves at a reasonable pace if you are willing to dedicate your semester to it.',\n",
       " u'WORK HARD ON PROBLEM SETS! Don\\'t stare at a problem, decide you can\\'t figure it out and ask your friends/TF for the answer. I learned this rather late and didn\\'t develop a healthy approach to solving problems...then on the midterm I suffered. Otherwise, I recommend taking at least 2 of the practice midterms/finals in a testing setting (yes that means waking up at x am, going through the motions you would on exam day and heading over to Cabot or Lamont and taking it \"for real.\"',\n",
       " u\"Great intro class but requires at least a decent math background. Difficulty is overstated I think. Much easier than math 25 so if you are taking that class, you'll have no trouble with this. Don't underestimate it though, even though the first half of the class may seem very familiar to people with experience in competition math.\",\n",
       " u\"This is a fantastic course taught by Prof Blitzstein. He is funny and clear, and the textbook and abundance of office hours helps make a difficult course more manageable. I found the first half of the course to be more interesting than the second half since the second half felt like just generalizing a lot of things you learned in the first half, although the last lecture(s) on Markov chains were super interesting. Overall, it's a tough but worthwhile course.\",\n",
       " u\"If you're a stat major, this is a req. course. I personally wasn't satisfied with the lectures, so I went to watch the 2011 ones on youtube, which are better organized and go over topics more in-depth. Be sure to understand topics as you go, or it's easy to fall behind and very,very hard to recover. Truly understand the key concepts and hw problems. At the end, this will pay off when studying for midterm/final.\",\n",
       " u\"Stat 110 is one of the most influential courses at Harvard. You WILL be pushed to think on your own and you'll learn the tools to solve so many real-world problems. Blitzstein and the TFs are amazing and really care about every student UNDERSTANDING the material, not just finishing the psets. Definitely take no matter what you plan on doing at Harvard/beyond.\",\n",
       " u\"I can't recommend this class enough.  Joe Blitzstein is an amazing teacher, the problems are fun (although sometimes tricky!), and while it is not an applied course, it provides a great foundation for tackling applied problems later on.  It is definitely hard, but you will learn a lot.  Absolutely worth taking for anyone in the natural sciences, social sciences, or CS.\",\n",
       " u'Carefully taught, with lots of resources.  Solid theoretical foundation in probability, which is more applicable to real world situations than it may seem at first.  Working in a group on problem sets is very useful. Material is plentiful and challenging, but the teaching is extremely well executed.',\n",
       " u'I loved this class. I took it as an elective to see why everyone thought it was so legendary.

I would only take it, though, if you are someone who enjoys problem solving and thinking creatively about analytical problems.',\n",

       " u'This class is a lot of work and is quite difficult.  If you like statistics/find it interesting, perhaps the effort needed would be worthwhile.  I unfortunately did not find it very interesting and thus somewhat painful.  It depends person to person.',\n",
       " u'Pretty tough but not as bad as people make it out to be - diligence makes it fairly manageable, as does the \"drop 2 Psets without penalty policy\" and the class is definitely worthwhile from an educational standpoint. Blitzstein is HILARIOUS and a really nice guy. Beware- the pace and difficulty picks up significantly after the midterm - the latter half of the semester is much harder.',\n",
       " u\"It's a great class, but don't put it alongside other hard classes in a semester.\",\n",
       " u\"I found that the psets averaged around ten hours each week, though this varies a lot from person to person. This number doesn't include textbook readings, which I highly recommend - the textbook is really good.\\r\\n\\r\\nI bought the textbook early and read through the first few chapters before the term started which helped me hit the ground running and not get overwhelmed by the beginning of the class.\\r\\n\\r\\nGet a strong psetting group/study buddies who you can rely on, and who plan to work on the psets around the same time of the week that you do (they're due in Friday noon, so plan for that).\\r\\n\\r\\nFind a good section leader, and go to section, even though they're optional. They really help your confidence and help to reinforce the main points of the material for that week - it can be easy to feel as though you're drowning in too much information, but section kinda distills it all, which is nice.\",\n",
       " u\"Easy if you have math competition experience, but otherwise you may have to deal with randomly not being able to do problems just because you aren't used to applying concepts that you've seen but aren't necessarily familiar with\",\n",
       " u'Although the material is quite difficult and the class is time consuming, the material is very cool, and Blitztein is a great lecturer. One of the best things about the class was the amount of support resources available. There are lots of practice problems and tests for the midterm and final, office hours are constant, and there are lots of sections.',\n",
       " u\"GO TO SECTION!! If you do nothing else for this class, go to section and office hours. Blitzstein is a terrible lecturer - he treats everything (even the most counter-intuitive stuff) as if it's obvious and doesn't properly explain anything so the TFs will be your saving grace in this class. Also, get a pset group together EARLY, the concepts pile up fast and it really helps if you have multiple minds to tackle them with. That said, this is a fun class  if you approach it correctly (DON'T GO IT ALONE) and you do learn a lot by the end of it.\",\n",

Prof. Blitzstein is exceptional at making most results at least somewhat intuitive.',\n",
       " u'Put in the time and actually make the effort to keep up with lecture (be it going to lecture or watching the video). It makes understanding and the homeworks much easier.

If you don't want something that's going to push you to your limits, then don't take it.

Problem sets start easy but escalate very quickly, and exams are difficult. That said, the class is rewarding and really impacts how you think about the world, and I'd highly recommend it to anyone who doesn't have an extra-challenging schedule already outside of this class and is interested in cool paradoxes, coincidences, thinking about things mathematically, and can put in the time to learn the theoretical parts well.\",\n",

Use your resources wisely.  Only take this class if you really know you can stay on top of your work, and definitely not with anything else high workload/difficulty.\\r\\n\\r\\nAll of that being said, I really hated this class once I fell behind.

The support for this class is great, with books, lots of notes, lots and lots of sections, and lots and lots and lots of practice material. Blitzstein and the TF's really care about your learning, and while there are a lot of ppl taking the class, the TF's try to be really available too.

Everything about it is simply amazing, but the thing that stands out the most is the focus on problem solving, and on intuition rather than brute computation (with only minimal sacrifices of mathematical rigor). This makes the class fun and enjoyable. As for difficulty, I think that if you have a high school contest math background (e.g. AMC/AIME) this will be a relatively painless extension of those concepts. But I have many friends who took the course without such a background and still found it very manageable- especially since you're allowed to drop 2 homeworks, and each homework is a consistent and very fair 7 problems. Also, I think having a good conceptual understanding of calculus (distinct from just knowing how to take derivatives and integrals) will make this class seem much more natural and straightforward, although it is not strictly necessary to do well in the course since again the emphasis is on intuition, not calculation. There's also a wealth of resources for help, from the extremely well-written textbook (which is essentially a carbon copy of this course since Blitzstein wrote it!) to the wonderful TFs who hold an inordinate number of sections and office hours every week. Highly recommend this class to anyone, and I loved it so much that I really want to TF it next year!\",\n",

It wasn't just the sheer amount of material we covered, but it was also the relevance of the material to real-world applications. Before this class, I didn't realize how prevalent these concepts are in all career fields, so this class is definitely a great introduction.\\r\\n\\r\\nHowever, just know that this class will need to be your priority in your schedule for the entire semester. The psets take on average of 8-10 hours a week and the readings are pretty dense to get through.

Stat 110 covers more material than any other course I have ever taken -- Blitzstein goes through 600 dense textbook pages by the end of the semester. Psets are very difficult, and you will need help from TFs or fellow students to complete them. If you don't keep up with lecture and learn the material on your own, you will absorb very little and be unprepared for the difficult exams. Blitzstein's lectures are sometimes enjoyable, but they are pretty much ripped right from the textbook (his textbook), so if you can learn directly from the textbook well, you will be in good shape.\",\n",

I didn't find this to be the case - there are plenty of pset problems that have real-world applications. I recommend this course with enthusiasm to all who want an introduction to statistics (if you've taken calculus).\",\n",

       "['If you sincerely care about contemporary international poetry, you will not regret this class. You have so much flexibility to explore the parts of poetry that matter to you AND learn about poets you would have otherwise never heard of. Although this is a Gen Ed, it will not be fun unless you truly enjoy poetry. The workload in this class is what you make out of it. The required readings are not that many, but there is a lot of supplementary poetry. At the end of the semester, you compile a portfolio with your own work and analysis, which is BY FAR one of the best assignments I have had during my time at Harvard.',\n",
       " \"Fun anecdote: when Harvard removed difficulty ratings from the Q Guide, UC members shopped this class in protest, which is why a 14-person class quadrupled in size. The best part of this story (and the takeaway), however, is that most of the people who shopped it as a joke ended up staying. Stephanie Sandler is a wonderful teacher and takes care of every student in the class - even if it's 40 people, it doesn't feel like you're ever lost in lecture. You also get to do so many different things in class: you'll have real live in-the-flesh poets come visit and talk about the work they do. You'll get to go to the Harvard Museum of Natural History and write about the gigantic dinosaur skeleton. You'll get to read and write some really awesome work and you will feel genuinely proud of it (given, of course, that you invest some care and effort). I'm leaving this course with more questions than answers, personally, but I feel happy about the conversations I had, the work I did, and the new-found appreciation for language I am taking away.\",\n",
       " \"This class was very interesting in section. However, the assignments were very vague sometimes and there was not a lot of direction in terms of how the papers should be written. This was hard to navigate, and they would not give you concrete feedback about your grade in the class, so you wouldn't know exactly where you stood at any point.\",\n",
       " 'This is an amazing course! Professor Sandler is really caring about not over-working students, and she radiates passion about the material. Additionally, we read poetry and then usually have the poet/translator come to the next class session to talk to us!',\n",
       " \"While the teaching staff cared very deeply about this class, it was a disappointment. Only take this class if you really, really love modern poetry. The poetry that you read in this class is often abstract and bizarre and translated and can leave you just scratching your head. If you're looking for Keats, if you want Whitman or any of the classics, take Vendler's Poems Poets and Poetry. That being said, there were times when the material was interesting and the work from week to week was minimal. Do not, though, leave the portfolio until the last minute. If you choose to take this class, take advantage of Professor Sandler and the TFs offering to read any material that you send them. The commitment for this class is completely what you make of it. Just make sure that you really like reading bizarre stuff. Also, I found it very dissatisfying because retrospectively, I realize that I didn't really reach any conclusions about the poetry that we read.\",\n",
       " 'Professor Sandler is a phenomenal lecturer, especially during the first few classes. After that, however, I kind of lost interest. I thought the class would focus on translation and interesting foreign authors, but for a nice chunk of time we talked about prison poetry (which almost bored me to tears). Many of the foreign authors we read were really interesting, but some were just so strange and (in my opinion) lackluster (Henry Parland), that they sort of discredited poetry for me.',\n",
       " \"Also, this class is not as easy as the Q guide makes it out to be. While the workload is relatively low, there are a handful of writing assignments that are sprinkled throughout the semester, almost in an arbitrary manner. Because these assignments are ungraded, it can be difficult to actually improve your writing style and your analytical tools, as there's little incentive, and the comments on assignments can be difficult to figure out (both because it's hard to read the TF's handwriting, and the comments are written in a very poetic way that makes it difficult to understand the meaning). Marton and Maria can be very harsh graders, but when you meet with them (at least, Marton) they will tell you they liked your paper but not really give you a good reason as to why you got a B/B+ on it.\",\n",
       " \"The midterm is the first graded assignment you have, so it can catch you off-guard. The grading doesn't seem to be that lenient, but you also aren't told what the class average is so it's hard to tell. Ask for feedback/help when you need or want it because the teaching staff is really helpful. You just have to take advantage of the available resources. They are all really passionate about poetry and about the course, so that makes discussing everything more enjoyable.\",\n",
       " 'Be careful they are hard graders',\n",
       " \"This is one of the BEST classes I've taken at Harvard. With very little poetry background and just a lot of interest, I feel like I learned so much and really got to explore something I became passionate about. It also doesn't overwhelm you with work. If you like poetry even a little bit, you will love this course. TAKE THIS CLASS!\",\n",
       " 'Really great learning experience. Make sure to participate in class.',\n",
       " 'This class is relatively easy to do, but requires that you have an authentic appreciation (or interest) in poetry; this will add more meaning to the class.',\n",
       " \"This is a great class if you're interested in poetry. I didn't really like the poetry I studied in high school but this class takes a completely different approach to it. Professor Sandler is amazing an I really enjoyed having her as my professor.\",\n",
       " 'I would tell them that this class is excellent for delivering interesting poetry, but that they need to be prepared to receive little feedback on written work, and perhaps for frustrating discussions from time to time. Like any class on literature that is open to a more general audience, and not reserved for students who are more advanced in a lit/poetry related field, some conversation will seem to read into the poems too much. This is annoying but the net value is excellent.',\n",
       " 'I loved this class. There was a decent amount of work, but it was never overwhelming. Professor Sandler and the TFs were wonderful, and always enthusiastic about making sure all of the students were enjoying the class. There were so many opportunities to learn about poetry and about art in general through poetry readings, guest lecturers, museum visits, and assignments. I would recommend with high enthusiasm!',\n",

Professor Sandler is a wonderful educator, who deeply cares for her work and primarily her students. If you can take this course, do it!',\n",
       " \"1) dont take this class if you haven't had much experience with reading/writing poetry before. it is hard to do well otherwise.\",\n",
       " '2) if you want to take a course where you hope to be introduced to contemporary poetry worldwide, take this class. however, you will not learn to appreciate poetry any better after this class; you basically skim over every poet/book in 2 classes, and most of those classes are filled more with student comments than with instructional comments. if you want to learn how to appreciate/read/write poetry, take the poetry gen ed taught by helen vendler.',\n",
       " \"3) don't get maria as a tf. very harsh grader!\",\n",
       " \"4) if you're looking for a light courseload-ey course, take this class! you just basically need to turn in a four page midterm, a four page final, and a portfolio where you basically mimic all the poets you read in class. there are also like four/five one page assignments but they arent graded and you can basically bs them. besides these assignments, there is no other work or any readings for the classes; you  can basically show up without any reading done and still talk in class because we usually talk about short poems, and you can basically ride off what others are saying.\",\n",
       " \"Wonderful teaching staff. Stephanie Sandler and Maria Vassileva are so knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the course material, as well as very kind people. They understand that AI11 is probably not your top priority, which is something rare at a school were so many professors assign and teach as if their course was the only course you were taking / the only one that mattered. They understand that people are probably not doing all the readings (and the good thing about taking a poetry class is that you can kind of do the reading during class.... shhh....), and the assignments, while never dumb, were light and fun. You always have a choice on what to write on, and often you also have a choice between creative and analytical, so you'll be able to find something to write about that interests you! \",\n",
       " '',\n",
       " \"Contemporary poetry is harder than you think to read and appreciate. You will learn so much about how to read and make sense of it, and, if you're like me, you'll also learn how to use language and art to express yourself and think about things in ways you never did before. I was a reader writer before, but this course definitely made me grow as one in ways that even English and Creative Writing courses at Harvard didn't.\",\n",
       " 'If you think \"Literature\" cannot be bound within borders, and whether you love poetry or not, you must take this course.',\n",
       " \"If you really enjoy poetry, it'll provoke lots of interesting discussions that will broaden your ability to think analytically about literature.\",\n",
       " \"This class is great because it exposes you to poets that you likely will never otherwise discover/encounter.  The downside of this is that some of these poets are extremely difficult/bizarre--but the teaching staff is really dedicated to helping you discover the value in working through difficult poetry like this.  Also, the fact that so many of the poets/translators in the syllabus come into class to talk is pretty amazing.  If nothing else, I'd recommend this class for the opportunity to hear Valzhyna Mort speak--I'd never read her poetry before, but I'm now absolutely in love with it.  She is one of the coolest people I've ever heard speak.\",\n",

If you come in with an open mind, you'll definitely get a lot out of the poems that we read in class. The teaching staff is also incredible, and the structure of the class overall is very organized and manageable.\",\n",
       " 'This was an awesome introduction into modern poetry.',\n",
       " 'This is a wonderful course to learn interesting facets of poetry that are not likely explored in other, more traditional poetry courses. If you are interested in completing open-ended assignments on things such as ekphrasis, translation, and the art of language itself then definitely take the class. Professor Sandler does an amazing job at making every \"lecture\" engaging; however, do be warned about the many hours you will spend in class itself and how unclear many of the expectations for the course are. In addition, the TFs do little to help prepare you for the major assignments such as the take-home midterms and finals.',\n",
       " \"This class is awesome. Definitely take it if you have any interest whatsoever in poetry. Stephanie and Maria (TF) are both super accessible and enthusiastic. It's not a huge amount of work (but also not a class you can just blow off), and all the assignments are really interesting.\",\n",
       " \"Buy all the books at the very beginning, and do the readings. They're enjoyable, so why not?\",\n",
       " \"This is a hard class.  The workload is low, but that does not mean it is easy.  This class made me really dislike some of my classmates, you'll find class and section is take over by hardos wanting to get their brilliant ideas in.\",\n",
       " \"If you like poetry, it's a great class with not too much work involved. If you're not great at reading poetry, every class discussion breaks down the poems you're reading so you can get by with no problem. They give options for creative assignments or analytical. Professor Sandler's also brilliant!\",\n",
       " 'This is a rigorous and very stimulating course.',\n",
       " 'Incredibly stimulating. You get to read amazing poetry and discuss it in great detail. Truly eye-opening, this class almost redefines what poetry is.',\n",
       " \"It's a good class if you enjoy poetry or discussing it in ways that you may not have normally thought of. It certainly provides an interesting insight into the idea of poetic voice.\",\n",
       " 'This class provides students the opportunity to strengthen their analysis of poetic texts. The course instructors challenge us and utilize other methods of instruction to teach the vast coursework of poetry.',\n",
       " \"You read some very interesting poetry from Russian poetry to Chinese poetry to war poetry.  This class does not demand a ton of time but the more you put in the more you'll get out of it.\",\n",
       " 'I highly recommend this course as an introduction to deep reading poetry, and to looking at translated poetry as a major theme.  It sparks deep thought and is thoroughly enjoyable.',\n",
       " \"One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.\",\n",
       " \"Take the class, it's a bizarre, fun, sometimes personally difficult, in the end truly enriching experience.\",\n",
       " \"This course is a useful challenge for those who love poetry; it forces you to experience poems on an intimate level, in ways you've never experienced.  In the end, you'll be glad you made the effort.\",\n",
       " 'If you are really into poetry (and i mean even the boring kind) this is perfect for you. Not everything we read is boring, but you may come across really unfamiliar poetry that can be frustrating to understand. If you like a challenge and can get past that, then go for it.',\n",
       " 'Difficult but very rewarding',\n",
       " \"An interesting way to looks at all kinds of poetic art -- both written and visual.  The visits from established poets are a real treat; it's amazing to meet and get to know people who actually do this for a living.\",\n",
       " 'Awesome course! We focused on areas such as translation, art, writing in exile, grief, and many more. Great class if you are in the least bit interested in poetry!',\n",
       " \"This class exposed me to new realms of poetry. I previously focused on traditional poetry, but I learned to appreciate visual poetry and more modern abstract poetry. The course focuses mostly on Russian literature, so keep that in mind. Professor Sandler is a fantastic teacher, but you will get more out of this course if you have background knowledge of modern poetry. There isn't much time to establish context throughout the course.\",\n",
       " 'I love this class! You are constantly thinking about the boundaries of language - both between cultures and within. The readings introduce you to a wonderful variety of writers (especially Slavic ones) and the poems were often gorgeous.',\n",
       " 'You may not want to take this course as an \"introduction to poetry\" because it discusses techniques and styles that it would be better for you to have already seen! But regardless, this class was AMAZING. It made me love poetry and it made me think of translation in ways that I never thought I would!',\n",
       " \"One of the best classes I've taken at Harvard.  How often do we find ourselves honestly excited to tackle every single assignment in a course? Poetry is great because no matter what your background is, you'll be able to find incredible, rich places of entry.\",\n",
       " 'This course will pleasantly surprise you. By the end of the semester, your relationship with words will completely change. Most engaging and meaningful gen ed. course.',\n",
       " \"You can sort of 'skim' this class if you really want to...but there is a LOT you can learn or at least find you want to learn from this class. A whole bunch of poetic little gems throughout the course...There is also a refreshing absence of pressure/anxiety in this course. Its explorative and fun. Interested in poetry? Take it, take it, take it.\",\n",
       " 'Changed my approach to poetry. Constantly thought-provoking and inspirational.',\n",
       " \"Again, know the kind of poetry you're getting into. If you don't like it, you'll be miserable. If you love it, you'll be in hog heaven.\",\n",
       " 'There are some really great readings for this course. You can put in as much or as little time as you want into this course, with what you get out being proportional to that. Stephanie Sandler and Ainsley are both incredibly wonderful people.',\n",
       " \"This class is awesome! Professor Sandler and the TF Ainsley are so enthusiastic about what they teach, and it makes classes and sections fly by. The material is interesting as well, even if you don't have much prior experience with looking at poetry. The workload is very manageable and the readings and assignments are mostly enjoyable.\",\n",
       " 'Fantastic class. Great speakers and field trips. Professor Sandler is passionate and wonderful at lecturing and facilitates interesting discussions. She allowed us to do creative work for our portfolio, which became the most fun assignment I did this semester.',\n",
